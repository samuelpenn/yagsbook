        <summary>
            Basic core rules for the Yags combat system, aiming for a
            gritty-cinematic style of play. Includes rules for melee,
            unarmed combat, missile combat and modern firearms. Rules
            for getting wounded, and getting healed are also included.

            <title>Basic Combat</title>

            <para>
                The combat system of any roleplaying game is probably one
                of the most important aspects of the whole game, even if
                combat isn't itself meant to be the focus of the game.
                In some ways, it is the only part of the system that can
                lead to character death - even a botched etiquette skill
                check in front of a king will only kill you if the combat
                system says that you can't dodge or fight the guards.
            </para>

            <para>
                Yags combat is reasonably detailed, providing a lot of
                choices to players and their characters, both at character
                design time and during combat itself. However, the aim is
                for something that is simple and fast flowing most of the
                time, with options for doing complex stuff when the need
                arises.
            </para>

            <para>
                In terms of style, Yags tries for a gritty-cinematic
                approach. Combat can be deadly, especially if you try to
                bite off more than you can chew. A single lucky roll is
                unlikely to kill you, but it can put you on the floor
                bleeding to death. Unless you are very good, taking on
                multiple opponents can be suicide, and the core system
                is meant to be reasonably realistic in this regard.
            </para>

            <para>
                However, Yags does allow for very skilled characters. A
                sword thrust, or a bullet, can kill anyone, however much
                of a hero they think they are. On the other hand, if you
                are of the skill of <e>Azumi</e>, <e>Beatrice Kiddo</e>
                or <e>River</e> then you should be able to disarm, kill
                or evade everyone before they get to stick you with
                something sharp.

                <title>Organisation of These Rules</title>

                <para>
                    These rules have been organised so as to keep the
                    simple stuff first, then go into more detail later.
                    The first few sections actually gives you everything
                    you need to know to run combat using Yags. If all
                    you want is a simple and fast combat system, then
                    you can stick with that.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The later sections go into more detail however,
                    providing a bit more colour to the rules, and
                    covering situations more extensively.
                </para>

                <title>General Terminology</title>

                <para>
                    The following terms are used frequently within
                    these rules, so they are described up front. A
                    full description of how they are used will be
                    given later.
                </para>

                <itemlist order="sort">
                    <item name="Round">
                        A round is a unit of time, averaging about five
                        seconds. Each round, a character has chance to
                        perform a single action - normally an attack or a
                        move.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Body levels">
                        Every creature has a number of body levels, which
                        represent their ability to absorb damage. The number
                        of body levels determines how many wounds and stuns
                        a creature can take before it falls over.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Soak">
                        Soak is how good a creature is at
                        resisting (soaking) damage. An adult
                        human will usually have a base soak of
                        12. Any armour worn adds to this.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Wounds">
                        Wounds are serious injuries which have a good chance
                        of causing death. Most weapons cause wound damage.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Stuns">
                        Stuns are non-serious injuries which rarely kill,
                        being generally limited to stuns and bruises.
                        Excessive stun damage may lead to wounds however.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Mixed damage">
                        Mixed damage is half stuns, half wounds with odd
                        damage going on stuns. Many animals and light
                        bludgeoning weapons cause mixed damage.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Ineffective damage">
                        As stun damage, but the number of stuns applied is
                        halved (rounding down). Stun attacks may be reduced
                        to ineffective damage, but no attack does
                        ineffective as standard.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Fatigue">
                        Fatigue is a measure of how tired a creature is.
                        Unlike wounds and stuns, the amount of fatigue a
                        creature can handle is based on their health.
                        Fatigue can be recovered with a short rest.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Exhaustion">
                        Exhaustion is similar to fatigue, but can only be
                        recovered with sleep. It is gained from long term
                        physical activity such as hiking or heavy labour.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Damage">
                        Damage normally causes either stuns or wounds.
                        It is reduced by a creature's soak before being
                        applied.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Load">
                        A character can carry a load equal to the square of
                        their strength without penalty. Weapons, armour
                        and equipment carried add to load.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Stance">
                        Stance determines how a combatant is fighting, the
                        most common being normal, aggressive and defensive.
                        Prone and unsteady are two stances which a character
                        can be forced into.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Free strike">
                        An extra attack which may be taken immediately
                        against a given opponent. The opponent gets a free
                        defence roll, at the same penalty as other defence
                        rolls that round if multiple defenses have been
                        declared.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Counter strike">
                        An extra attack which make be taken immediately
                        after the opponent's action which triggered it,
                        but otherwise treated as a free strike.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Automatic strike">
                        An extra attack which may be taken immediately
                        against a given opponent. The opponent does not get
                        a defence roll, so the attack is against the base
                        difficulty to hit the target.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Combat bonuses">
                        The three statistics which define the bonuses a
                        weapon provides to skill and damage rolls in combat
                        (attack, defence and damage).
                    </item>

                    <item name="Initiative">
                        Initiative determines the order in which everybody
                        acts, from highest initiative to lowest. Actions
                        are split into fast, normal and slow. All fast
                        actions happen first, then normal actions, then
                        slow actions.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Martial weapon">
                        Any melee weapon which does better than stun damage
                        and has a reach greater than zero.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Distance">
                        The distance to a target for missile weapons,
                        measured in metres. This affects how hard it is
                        to hit the target, and my be modified up or down
                        depending on other factors (such as if you're
                        running whilst trying to shoot).
                    </item>

                    <item name="Range band">
                        The effective range of missile weapons, measured in
                        metres. This is unaffected by modifiers to the
                        Distance, and effects how much damage the weapon
                        does.

                <title>Combat skills</title>

                <para>
                    There are a number of different skills used in combat,
                    each skill covering a particular style of fighting. It
                    is not necessary to learn a different skill for every
                    weapon - a skill with <e>single weapon</e> will allow
                    you to use any one handed melee weapon for example.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The detailed combat system provides differences between
                    how these skills are used. For now though, the only
                    difference is in which weapons they can be used with.
                    See the descriptions of these skills in the Skills
                    section for more details.

                <para>
                    Every melee weapon provides three combat bonuses -
                    <e>attack</e>, <e>defence</e> and <e>damage</e> which
                    add to the attack, defence an damage rolls of a

                <para>
                    There are plenty of other statistics for each weapon,
                    but these three are the primary ones which are used
                    in the basic combat system.

                <para>
                    Every creature has a basic soak score, which reduces
                    the damage done to them in an attack. Armour gives a
                    protective bonus which adds to this soak, thereby
                    reducing the damage done in an attack.

            <title>The Combat Sequence</title>

            <para>
                Once characters enter into a combat, game time is
                measured in <e>rounds</e> of approximately
                five seconds. At the start of each combat everybody
                determines their <e>initiative</e> which remains
                fixed for the entire combat. Initiative is rolled
                using:

                If you fumble your initiative roll, then you may not act
                for the first round of combat. If you were in the middle
                of doing something (running, picking something up) then
                you may continue doing that however (but cannot attack,
                or declare defences).

                <title>The Combat Round</title>

                <para>
                    Each round of combat follows a set series of steps.
                    Once a round has been completed, combat either ends
                    or everyone starts a new round. Initiative is very
                    important in combat, since a high initiative gives
                    a character a big tactical advantage over everyone
                    else.

                <para>
                    At the start of each round, all combatants declare
                    their actions in order of increasing initiative. This
                    gives characters with a high initiative a big tactical
                    advantage over everybody else. Initiative should be
                    thought of as an abstraction of both physical speed and
                    tactical ability.
                </para>

                <para>
                    All declared actions are public, even if someone
                    is out of sight at the start of the round. If you
                    are hidden and out of sight, and wish to declare
                    that you are leaping out to attack someone, then
                    anyone who has a higher initiative than you gets
                    the opportunity to react to your action before
                    you do it - effectively they get to act between
                    you making yourself visible and actually performing
                    the attack.

                    <para>
                        You may declare an attack against a
                        target. Any movement required in order to make
                        the attack is implied. The weapon and skill
                        being used, plus any special actions, must be
                        declared at this point.

                        You must declare the number of defences though do
                        not need to declare who they are against. Each
                        declared defence will defend against any number of
                        attacks from a single attacker. Defending against
                        multiple attackers means you suffer a penalty to
                        all attacks and defences that round.

                        the average of your agility and perception
                        (rounded up), which is 3 for typical characters.

                        If you have lost the initiative, you may declare

                        waiting for, and what you will do if it occurs.
                        If the event doesn't happen, then you don't do
                        anything that round.

                        attack which is <e>slow</e>. Movement faster than

                        When an attack is made, the defender must declare

                        rolls are made. If they do not do so, then the

                                Critically stunned. Most people will stop
                                fighting at this point, since they are
                                quite close to falling over.

                                A beaten person must make a health check to
                                remain conscious every round they wish to
                                act.

                        <para>
                            For example, you are currently uninjured, but
                            are punched by someone who does you two stuns.
                            You are now lightly stunned (at -5). You are
                            punched again for two stuns. This gives you
                            one extra stun, taking you to three stuns
                            (moderate, -10). A third punch only does one
                            stun, and since this is less than half your
                            current total, it does no damage.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            The fourth punch is much harder, and does 5
                            stuns of damage. This is greater than your
                            current total (3), so puts you immediately
                            at 5 stuns (critical, -25).
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            If your stuns ever reach beaten, then you must
                            make a health check as for wounds, but failure
                            makes you unconscious, and success leaves you
                            standing.

                        <para>
                            Note that stuns and wounds are kept track of
                            seperately, and their penalties add together.
                            If you have 3 stuns (moderate, -10) and two
                            wounds (light, -5) you have a total penalty of
                            -15.

                            The final type of damage is <e>Mixed</e>. Mixed
                            damage is split between stuns and wounds, with
                            the first going on stuns. Mixed damage adds
                            cumulatively to both stuns and wounds. If you
                            have four stuns, and take one level of mixed
                            damage, you take one stun, giving you five stuns
                            total.

                    At the end of each round, any general
                    book keeping can be performed. If health rolls
                    are needed to remain conscious, then they are
                    made now.
