                This skill is mostly about digging up the ruins of
                ancient civilisations, and covers the practical
                skills needed to find, recognise and preserve items,
                as well as basic management - social, equipment
                and legal. It does also include knowledge of how to
                identify and date ruins, as well as general knowledge
                of specific civilisations. However, detailed
                knowledge of ancient history requires the <e>History</e>
