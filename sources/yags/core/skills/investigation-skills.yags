                You have studied criminals and the crimes they commit,
                in an attempt to better catch them. This is normally
                the domain of law enforcement.

                The skill of forging identity cards and the like. You know
                how to obtain the materials necessary for creating forgeries,
                can detect a forged document or card, and can create them
                yourself as long as you have the necessary information.
                Some forms of forgery will require modifying database
                records, which will require <e>Computer operation</e> and
                similar skills which <e>Forgery</e> does not provide,
                however it will let you know what databases need to be
                changed.

                You have experience in the various tasks involved in breaking
                into buildings. Opening basic locks, forcing doors
                and windows, and knowledge about how buildings are generally
                designed come under this skill.

                more suited to life amongst the criminal classes. With it,
                comes knowledge of how to survive on the street, how to
                gain the trust of those who live on the wrong side of the
                law, as well as how to find them in the first place.

                Being able to scare people, either with threats of simple
                physical violence, or by more subtle means. Can either be
                based on <t>Strength</t> or <t>Empathy</t>. When making an
                intimidation check, make an opposed roll against the
                target's <t>Will</t> (modified by any traits). Each level
                of success will shift the target's level of cooperation
                up by a category.

            <para>
                Modifiers to the target difficulty are given below. The
                level of apparent threat that you represent needs to
                be relative to any other threats that the target needs to
                consider. For example, you may have a hot poker, but the
                mob may apply a hot poker to him, and his entire family,
                if he betrays them.
