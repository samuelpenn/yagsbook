                Accountancy provides you with the knowledge of how to
                manage the finances of a business or organisation.
                It includes knowledge of tax laws, legal requirements
                and how to use common tools (including computers) needed
                to do your job.
            </para>

            <para>
                With a <e>moderate</e> success you can meet all the
                legal requirements and ensure the figures are right.
                If you get at least a <e>poor</e> result, then failures
                can be fixed the following month. A <e>good</e> success
                allows you to perform some creative accountancy, whilst
                an <e>excellent</e> success allows lots of creative
                accountancy and making best use of tax laws.
