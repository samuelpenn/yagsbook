                This is the skill of fighting with melee weapon. It can be
                used with pretty much any standard weapon type, including
                blades, spears, shields and clubs. Particularly exotic
                weapons may require <e>Techniques</e> to be able to use
                them effectively.

                their use with a shield or a second parrying weapon.
                Exotic weapons, such as chain weapons, aren't covered
                since they are used in a completely different way. Small

            <para>
                The knowledge of how to use a bow such as a short bow, long
                bow or composite bow. For long bows, for every full four
                points of skill, the effective strength of the character is
                increased by one for purposes of determining the <e>pull</e>

            <para>
                This skill can be used with crossbows, though reload times

                Covers the use of all varieties of hand held crossbows.
                Skill in this provides accuracy, and also enables
                quicker reloading of the heavier versions of the crossbow.

                The skill can be used with bows, though range penalties

                You are skilled in firing pistols and similar small hand
                guns, including revolvers, automatic pistols and SMGs.
                This skill is most effective at short ranges and when in
                close combat with the target. It is always based on
                <t>Dexterity</t>.

                The use and handling of rifles, carbines, shotguns

                but is designed for short to medium ranges. Can be used
                with either <t>Dexterity</t> or <t>Perception</t>.
                Add-ons to rifles such as an underslung grenade launcher
                may also be used with this skill instead of the more

                This skill provides you with knowledge of how to use
                heavy weapons such as vehicle mounted machine guns,
                grenade launchers, anti-tank weapons and mortars.
                Most non-man portable weapons fall into this

            <para>
                The <e>gunnery</e> skill covers the use of very large
                vehicle mounted or emplacement weapons, such as artillery
                and battleship main guns. Whereas <e>Heavy weapons</e>
                covers "barely man portable in a Hollywood action film"
                weapons, Gunnery is only for the really big weapons which
                often require several crew members to operate. Will
                often use <t>Intelligence</t>, since doing the maths to
                plot the trajectory is generally more important than
                quick reflexes.
