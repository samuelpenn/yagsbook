            <para>
                This is the skill of fighting with melee a weapon. It can be
                used with pretty much any standard weapon type, including
                blades, spears, shields and clubs. Particularly exotic
                weapons may require <e>Techniques</e> to be able to use
                them effectively. <e>Melee</e> is normally used with
                <t>Dexterity</t>. Small or improvised weapons such as
                knives and daggers use the <e>Brawl</e> skill.

                Tactics, strategy and leadership when planning and fighting
                a battle involving small groups. It can be used to
                choose a suitable site for battle, to determine weaknesses
                in the enemy's strategy and defences, and to plan the
                logistics of travel and supply.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You know how to use all types of bows, such as short bows,
                long bows and crossbows. As well as providing accuracy, you
                can use this skill to improve time to reload bows such as
                crossbows. Crossbows tend to be easy to use, but other types
                of bows can be difficult to master so to make most use of
                them requires also learning suitable techniques.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you don't have this skill, then range penalties are doubled
                for standard bows, and reload times are doubled for crossbows.
                Also, the fumble chance is increased to 3 for standard bows.

                The use and handling of pistols, revolvers, SMGs,
                shotguns, rifles, carbines and the like. Heavier
                weapons such as light machine guns and rocket
                launchers come under <e>Heavy Weapons</e>, but
                can default to <e>Guns</e>.
            </para>

            <para>
                If using a <e>Pistol</e>, then you use <e>Guns</e>
                with <t>Dexterity</t>. When using a <e>Rifle</e>, you
                may opt to use <t>Perception</t> instead. Add-ons to
                rifles such as underslung grenade launchers which would
                normally use the <e>Heavy Weapons</e> skill, may
                be used with the <e>Guns</e> skill and
                <t>Perception</t>, but only if they're an add-on.
            </para>

            <para>
                At short range, you may normally add the attack bonus of
                the weapon to your attack roll unless you are making a
                <e>snapshot</e>.

            <para>
                This skill provides you with knowledge of how to use
                heavy weapons such as vehicle mounted machine guns,
                grenade launchers, anti-tank weapons and mortars.
                Most non-man portable weapons fall into this
                category. Always uses <t>Perception</t> when
                firing weapons.

                <e>Very</e> large weapons (naval guns, tank guns,
                starship mounted particle accelerators) come under the
                <e>Gunnery</e> skill. If it requires more maths than
                judgement, then it's probably <e>Gunnery</e>.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                The <e>gunnery</e> skill covers the use of very large
                vehicle mounted or emplacement weapons, such as artillery
                and battleship main guns. Whereas <e>Heavy weapons</e>
                covers "barely man portable in a Hollywood action film"
                weapons, Gunnery is only for the really big weapons which
                often require several crew members to operate. Will
                often use <t>Intelligence</t>, since doing the maths to
                plot the trajectory is generally more important than
                quick reflexes.
