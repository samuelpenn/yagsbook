            <para>
                You have experience with dealing with animals. This is
                quite a broad skill, since it covers calming animals,
                training them and using them effectively. It does not
                however cover the riding of animals.

        <short>Living in the wilderness.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                With this skill, you are capable of surviving on many
                different types of terrain by foraging and hunting. There
                is a single skill, which covers all terrain types, though
                a number of techniques are needed to survive in harsh
                environments without penalty. <e>Survival</e> also covers
                tracking, finding shelter and travelling safely and
                quickly.
            </para>

            <para>
                On coastal lands (where it is possible to fish), plains,
                woodlands and low mountain regions, the basic skill will
                suffice. In desert, arctic or jungle environments, then
                a technique is required. High mountains may count as
                arctic, swamps may count as coastal or jungle, depending
                on the exact environment.
            </para>
        </description>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Foraging">
            <para>
                When foraging for food, it takes four hours
                for each roll. Each five over the difficulty allows enough
                food to be found for another two people. If more food is
                found than is needed, then the forager has the option of
                stopping early as soon as enough food has been found. Assume
                that food is found at a consistent rate through the time
                period.
            </para>
        </description>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Hunting">
            <para>
                Similar to foraging, it takes four hours
                for each attempt to hunt game. Success indicates that
                suitable game has been found, and relevant combat skills
                are required to actually kill the animal. In this case,
                game is large game animals, such as deer.
            </para>
        </description>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Navigation">
            <para>
                Anyone with any survival skill can
                navigate by use of the sun and stars. This is unaffected
                by the terrain type and difficulty of surviving in that
                terrain. When attempting to navigate, use the character's
                highest survival skill.
            </para>
        </description>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Tracking">
            <para>
                Survival can be used to track others by
                their footprints and other signs. It is possible to
                estimate the type of animal, their number and how long it
                has been since the tracks were made. Of course, it can be
                used to track people as well.
