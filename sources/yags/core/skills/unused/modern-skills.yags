                This skill is mostly about digging up the ruins of

                A style of unarmed combat which concentrates on throws and
                locks. It is designed for real combat, and has a number of
                techniques to get your opponent into a position ready to
                be thrown or grabbed.

            <para>
                You gain a +1 to your agility for all trip attacks and
                defences, and always use <y:agility>Aikijutsu</y:agility>
                for such manouevres. If fighting from the prone position,
                you suffer no penalties. It can otherwise be used in place
                of <e>Brawl</e> for punches, kicks, dodges and other
                unarmed combat moves.
            </para>

            <para>
                If using a weapon, you gain the damage bonus of the weapon
                and suffer a +1 increase in the fumble chance.

            <para>
                <e>Karate</e> is one of the popular (or at least, well
                known) styles of unarmed combat in the modern world. It
                is specialised in attack rather than defence. Though it
                is often used as a sport, it is effective in a real fight
                as well.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is used in the same way as <e>brawl</e> in combat,
                though it does not teach the use of weapons. When fighting
                unarmed, you gain a bonus to damage equal to your skill,
                but suffer a -1 penalty to agility for defence rolls.
