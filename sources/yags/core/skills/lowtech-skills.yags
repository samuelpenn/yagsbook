            <para>
                Performing major operations on a wounded person. This
                requires some specialist tools (though rarely more
                complicated than sharp knives and tongs). It is used
                with <e>intelligence</e>.
            </para>

            <para>
                A chirurgury attempt takes an hour, and may be performed
                on a person with wounds. Stuns are unaffected by use of
                this skill. The difficulty is equal to 20 + the wound
                (not stun) penalties of the patient. Success results in
                the patient automatically healing one wound at their
                next natural healing check, <e>before</e> the check is
                made. Only one chirurgury check can be made each day
                on a single patient, but once one has been successful,
                not further attempts count until the patient is wounded
                again.
            </para>

            <para>
                A fumble results in the patient receiving an extra

                further attempts can be made.

                Making metal armour such as mail, plate or ring armour.

                taking a week. Failure means a flaw in the item, though
                an <skeq><attr>intelligence</attr><sk>armoury</sk></skeq>
                check at the same difficulty allows the armourer to notice
                and fix the flaw.

            <para>
                The armourer can choose to double the difficulty in order
