                systems. After the Enlightenment, Economics and
                Political theory will split out from Philosophy, but
                currently this isn't the case.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Alchemy had always been the domain of wizards and
                conjurers, and was capable of not much more than
                producing flashes, bangs and strange smells. With
                the Enlightenment, it becomes the forerunner to
                <e>Chemistry</e>, and begins to take on more of
                a scientific nature.
            </para>

            <para>
                However, Alchemy is still tied strongly to the
                classical ways of thinking about the world, and by
                the time scientists start to figure out the true
                nature of the elements, it begins to fade into the
                background.

            <para>
                With the birth of science, <e>Astrology</e> begins the
                gradual shift towards <e>Astronomy</e>. However, it is
                still bound by religious and classical thought, for
                it teaches that the heavens are mystical, and have
                power over men. It's primary purpose is to better
                calculate the positions and movements of the stars and
                planets in order to produce better horoscopes.

        <short>Dueling with light bladed weapons.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                The skill of fighting with a light bladed weapon, such
                as a rapier. With the spread of firearms, fencing is
                being regulated to dueling, though its use in a real
                combat should not be underestimated.
            </para>

            <para>
                It also allows the use of a second smaller weapon
                (such as a dagger or knife). If two long weapons are
                required, then the <e>Two weapons</e> skill should
                still be used.
            </para>

            <para>
                Note that this is <e>not</e> the sport of fencing, and
                the point of the skill is to kill another person, not
                to win points.

                The skill required to load, clean and fire a black

                use of all long barreled weapons such as muskets,
                flintlocks, wheellocks and matchlocks. Cartridge based
                weapons are covered with the <e>Rifle</e> skill.

                early firearms with short barrels designed to be used
                in one hand. Unlike cartridge based weapons, they
                often require loading black powder by hand before
                each shot.
