            <title>Carrying, Finding and Buying</title>

            <para>
                The following sections of this article list the most common
                items of equipment that it is possible to buy. Initially
                though there is a brief summary of the rules side of
                things - encumbrance, limitations on buying stuff and
                other things.
            </para>

                <title>Encumbrance</title>

                <para>
                    How much a person can carry is based on their strength.
                    The more they carry, the greater the penalties when trying
                    to perform physical actions. A character can normally
                    carry up to the square of their strength (in kg) without
                    any penalty. If they try to carry more than this, then
                    they are penalised.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The following table shows the penalties for given levels
                    of encumbrance. The encumbrance column lists the maximum
                    load that can be carried as a multiple of their base
                    amount (strength squared).
                </para>

                    <item target="0" value="Unencumbered (x1).">
                        A character can carry up to the square of their
                        strength without being encumbered.
                    </item>

                    <item target="1" value="Light (x2).">
                        A character who carries more than the square of their
                        strength (but no more than twice this) is lightly
                        encumbered, and has a -1 penalty to agility.

                    <item target="2" value="Moderately (x3).">
                        Character has a -1 penalty to both agility and
                        dexterity.

                    <item target="3" value="Heavily (x6).">
                        Character has a -2 penalty to agility and a -1
                        penalty to dexterity.
                    </item>

                    <item target="4" value="Greatly (x10).">
                        A greatly burdened character has a -2 penalty to
                        both agility and dexterity.
                    </item>

                    <item target="5" value="Over encumbered.">
                        Character cannot move, all agility checks are
                        automatically zero and -2 to dexterity.
                    </item>
                </targetlist>

                <para>
                    The level of encumbrance is used in other situations.
                    When fatigue checks are made, it gives a -5 to the
                    roll per level of encumbrance.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It may also add a similar penalty if the character attempts
                    some athletic action that would be greatly affected by
                    encumbrance. Examples include jumping, swimming or
                    acrobatics.

                <title>Item Availability</title>

                <para>
                    Not all items are available for sale everywhere. An
                    elegant gold water clock won't be found in a typical
                    village, however you could probably buy as many eggs
                    as you wanted there.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Likewise, steel plate armour won't be available in
                    10th century London - you'd have to wait another
                    few hundred years for that.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Apart from cost, there are three principle things
                    which govern whether something can be bought at a
                    given location - <e>availability</e>, <e>legality</e>
                    and <e>technology</e>.

                <sect3>
                    <title>Availability</title>

                    <para>
                        All items have an availability rating, on a scale
                        of zero to five, with five being very rare items and
                        zero being things which can be picked up anywhere.
                    </para>

                            Such items are as common as dirt. They include
                            such things as firewood, chalk, clubs and
                            staves. They can be picked up from anywhere
                            either fully formed, or easily crafted by
                            anyone with opposable thumbs. They may still
                            have a price, which reflects the trouble
                            of someone going to pick the item up and
                            sticking it in a shop.

                            Such items are available in even small villages
                            for a reasonable cost. Even a farmstead will
                            have some, though non-renewable items may cost
                            a bit extra.

                            make. They will be common in small villages,
                            though not generally for sale. Larger villages
                            will tend to have them for common sale.

                            and most farm animals.

                            quality horses and most luxury items.

                            cities. Good quality or unusual weapons or
                            armour, luxury goods or items which require
                            a high degree of skill to make.

                        Availability can also be affected by the type of
                        good. Some items are listed as being
                        <e>specialist</e>. Such items are only available
                        from a few rare sources. For example, lock picks
                        won't be available from anyone other than a
                        locksmith or a thief.

                    <para>
                        Some items are noted as being <e>luxury</e> items.
                        These may not be available to common folk, or at
                        least anyone who looks like a commoner, just out
                        of snobbery.

                    <para>
                        Some items are, if not outright illegal, somewhat
                        shady in nature. Items marked as <e>illegal</e>
                        cannot be bought through normal channels. Contacts
                        with the criminal underworld or hefty bribes may be
                        required.

                    <para>
                        Some items are merely <e>shady</e>. A shady item
                        can be used for legal purposes, though a suspicious
                        looking person who buys such an item might get
                        reported to local law enforcement.

                        and armour would be one example, which aren't
                        permitted to be owned by non-nobles.

                    The monthly cost of living of a person will vary
                    according to their social class (or at least, the
                    social class they wish to emulate). Out in the
                    wilderness, everyone is pretty much equal. In a
                    village, there won't be much option, though an
                    innkeeper and his family may give up their private
                    rooms for someone of obvious importance.

            <para>
                There is a wide variety of armour available, varying in
                cost, weight and protective ability. Some armour is better
                against certain types of weapons than other armour -
                padded cloth can be better against crushing weapons than
                mail is, though mail is far superior against swords.
