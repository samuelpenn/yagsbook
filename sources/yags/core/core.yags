            <title>What is Yags?</title>

            <para>
                <tm>Yags is Another Game System</tm>, one that is meant to
                provide a free, generic and modular set of rules for table
                top roleplaying. These rules do not describe what a role
                playing game is, or how to play one - it is assumed that
                you have played other RPGs before, and are either looking
                for something different, or simply want to flick through
                looking for rules to borrow for your own games.

            <para>
                <tm>Yags</tm> is split into a number of articles, of which
                this - <e>Core</e> - is the first. Each article provides
                detail on a different facet of the game, and two others
                - <e>Character</e> and <e>Combat</e> are recommended
                reading before running a game. Other articles are optional,
                and generally provide more detailed rules for a given
                setting, environment or situation.
            </para>

            <itemlist order="strict">
                <item name="Core Rules (orange)">
                    Basic rules, from simple task resolution to expanded
                    coverage of skills and environments. Most will be
                    setting neutral.
                </item>

                <item name="Character (green)">
                    Includes character generation and advancement,
                    skills, advantages and disadvantages and anything
                    else to do with defining a character.
                </item>

                <item name="Conflict (red)">
                    Mostly covers combat and other forms of conflict.
                </item>

                <item name="Catalogue (black)">
                    Any article which is just a description of items,
                    such as an equipment list or a bestiary.
                </item>

                <item name="Supernatural (blue)">
                    Anything magical or divine is covered under the
                    <e>Supernatural</e> category. These will nearly always
                    be setting specific.

                This then, is the core of the <e>Core Rules</e>, on which
                everything else is based. However, you don't need to read
                this first - if you just want to generate a character,
                then start with <e>Characters</e>, which gives a quick
                overview of the basics before showing you how to create a
                new character. This article is mostly of use to
                <e>Game Masters</e> who need a good understanding of how
                the rules work, and how they relate to things in the
                real world.

                <para>
                    <tm>Yags</tm> is designed to be generic, which means it's
                    not really aimed at any single setting or type of game.
                    At one point or another it has been used for fantasy,
                    science fiction and modern horror gaming. However, the
                    game rules do to some extent encourage a certain style
                    of game, and Yags is no exception.

                <para>
                    <tm>Yags</tm> is based on the concept of <e>Cinematic Realism</e>,
                    where characters can be heroic and perform great deeds,
                    but are always at the risk of death and dismemberment.
                    At its core, it aims for low fantasy realism, but puts
                    skill above luck, allowing experienced characters to
                    become heroic. A bullet can kill anyone, but a true hero
                    will make sure that they're not standing in front of the
                    gun.

                    This does mean you may republish (or even sell) these
                    rules yourself, even if you have modified them. The
                    only limitation is that all published versions of
                    these rules (including modifications) must also be
                    published under the GPL version 2, and that editable,

                        A rules system that is Free to modify and distribute
                        can be tailored for use by a group to match their
                        own playing styles. Gamers do this anyway, but Yags
                        is designed to make this easy. If you disagree with
                        the stats for a particular weapon, or how a skill
                        works, you can modify the original document and
                        print your own version of the rules - no more need
                        for scribbled notes in rule books, or pages of
                        extra sheets noting the changes and hoping everybody
                        remembers what has been changed.

            <title>The Core Mechanics</title>

            <para>
                <tm>Yags</tm> has a relatively simple set of basic rules
                which form the core of the rest of the system. This article
                provides a detailed description of these core rules for
                those interested in the basic mechanics or GMs
                wanting to extend <tm>Yags</tm>. For character generation,
                skill lists and the like see the <e>Character</e> article.

                <title>Terminology</title>

                <para>
                    The following terminology is used throughout the
                    <s>Yags</s> rules. Where these terms are used, the
                    specific definitions given here are what is meant.
                </para>

                <itemlist order="sort">
                    <item name="Attribute">
                        One of the eight basic numbers which define any
                        creature in Yags. A typical adult human has a
                        score of 3 in all their attributes. Attributes
                        are combined with a skill to determine a
                        creature's ability at a task.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Skill">
                        A skill defines a creature's training and
                        experience in a narrow field. Skills are combined
                        with attributes to determine a creature's ability
                        at a task. A competent level of skill is 4 or more.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Ability">
                        A creature's ability to achieve success in a task
                        is equal to an attribute multiplied by a skill, or
                        an attribute multiplied by 4 for a raw attribute check.
                        An average ability is considered to be 12.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Score">
                        The raw numerical value of any characteristic,
                        unmodified by anything else. A skill score would
                        be a creature's rating in a skill, before it is
                        multiplied by an attribute.

                    <item name="Task">
                        An activity that requires an ability check. To make
                        a check, roll 1d20 and add your ability to the
                        number rolled.

                    <item name="Die">
                        A single twenty sided die, a d20.

                    <item name="Difficulty">
                        A number which represents how difficult a task is.
                        You must roll your ability + d20 and equal or
                        exceed the difficulty of the task to succeed. A
                        moderate (average) task has a difficulty of 20.

                <para>
                    When you (as a character) perform a simple action in
                    <tm>Yags</tm>, such as walking or opening a door, you
                    will not normally be expected to make a die roll. If
                    the action is difficult or dangerous however, an
                    <e>ability check</e> may be required. The check is
                    used to determine both whether you succeed and also
                    how well you succeed.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The GM should determine the most suitable <e>attribute</e>
                    and <e>skill</e> combination to use, and set a target
                    level for the task. <e>Very easy</e> tasks have a target
                    of 10, <e>moderate</e> tasks have a target of 20 and
                    <e>difficult</e> tasks have a target of 30. In some cases
                    you may need to make a check just against an attribute
                    (for example, a <e>Health</e> check to remain conscious)
                    where no skill is involved.

                    To make a skill check, you roll <s>Attribute</s> x
                    <s>Skill</s> + 1d20, and if it equals or exceeds the
                    target difficulty then you succeed.

                    the target difficulty then you succeed.

                    If the d20 rolls a natural '1', then you automatically

                    In some situations, the fumble chance might be higher.

                    If it is important how well you succeed, then every 10
                    points by which you beat the target is considered an
                    extra level of success. Simply beating the target is
                    considered a <e>moderate</e> success, beating it by
                    10 or more is a <e>good</e> success (2 levels), by 20
                    or more is <e>excellent</e> and 30+ is <e>superb</e>.

                    Sometimes, a skill contest is called for between two or
                    more characters. In this case, instead of trying to beat
                    a set target number, you try to beat your opponent's
                    ability check.

                        If you have a score of 4 or higher in a skill, then
                        you are considered to be a professional and have
                        a couple of options available to you.

            <para>
                As with many game systems, <tm>Yags</tm> measures the ability
                of a character in the game using numerical stats, normally
                either <e>attributes</e> or <e>skills</e>. These numbers
                don't relate directly to anything in the real world - they
                are simply a convenient way to compare one thing to another.
            </para>

            <para>
                Since <tm>Yags</tm> is a game about human comparable characters,
                the statistics are designed to be easy to use when describing
                such characters. It is not so simple if used to compare the
                very small (rodents and insects), or the very large (giant
                mecha or world ships). These things aren't outside the scope of
                the game, but their involvement requires some special rules.
                For the former, see the <e>Bestiary</e>, for the latter see

                <para>
                    Attributes are the basic characteristics of all creatures
                    in <tm>Yags</tm>, and are a broad measure of natural talent
                    and potential. There are eight primary attributes -
                    strength, health, agility, dexterity, perception,
                    intelligence, empathy and will - and two secondary
                    attributes - size and move.
                </para>

                <para>
                    These attributes are consistent across all settings and
                    genres, and always work in the same way. The distribution
                    of values may vary. A fantasy setting with a rigid caste
                    system will have few examples of high attributes simply
                    because of the small numbers of people, the lack of
                    formalised training and inability for gifted people to
                    take up a role befitting their ability. A science fiction
                    setting with a population in the trillions, where people
                    are free to take the job they are best suited for, will
                    have more examples of gifted individuals which the PCs
                    will meet.

                    <title>Attribute Levels</title>

                    <para>
                        For humans, attributes tend to range between two
                        and five. Higher values are possible, but rare.
                        The following chart describes the different levels
                        from the point of view of an adult human.
                        Non-human creatures may work on different scales,
                        especially for strength which tends to be much
                        higher for large animals.

                            break and lift things. Some effects are based
                            on the square of your strength (e.g.

                            melee or missile weapons. Athletes, cat
                            burglars and martial artists require a good

                            and sensory ability. High perception characters
                            have good senses (vision, hearing) and
                            observational ability. Use of rifles and bows

                            know and remember things, to study and for logic.
                            Sages, researchers and scientists will use

                            not necessarily make you charismatic,
                            but a charismatic person will need a high
                            empathy in order to be able to react to and

                        The vast majority of humans will have an

                        simple randomisation is that an NPC has an
                        attribute of 3, unless a 1 or a 20 is rolled
                        on a d20. On a 1, the attribute is a 2,
                        whilst on a 20, it is a 4. This means the

                        about 90% of the population.

                    in his own skill. He loves to do what he does well and, having
                    done it well, he loves to do it better.

                    A skill is something which can be learnt and improved
                    through experience and training. Except for a few basic
                    skills, they always default to zero unless specifically
                    learnt. If a skill is zero, then it either can't be used
                    (in the case of many knowledge or science skills), can
                    default to another skill, or is rolled as a straight d20
                    halved (round down).

                    In some settings, it may be possible to learn skills
                    almost immediately, through cyborg implants or because
                    the world is some sort of simulation. It is highly
                    suggested that skills above four are very difficult
                    to obtain in such a way.

                        Once a skill is learnt, it's level ranges from one
                        upwards. There is no theoretical limit to how high
                        your skill can be, though a practical limit is in the
                        range of 10-15. Skills higher than 15 are considered
                        to be <e>mythical</e> - in the realm of supernatural

                        Sometimes a task is more suited to being resolved
                        with multiple skill checks. This is especially true
                        for challenges which are time critical, or which

                    <para>
                        Such tasks have a difficulty as normal, but require
                        a number of successes to be achieved before the task
                        is complete. For example, disabling a complex trap
                        may be difficulty 20/3, requiring 3 successes over
                        a base difficulty of 20. It's possible to achieve
                        success with a single roll of 40+. It may require
                        three rolls however.

                        If a check fails, then no successes are gained towards
                        completion, and the fumble chance for all further checks
                        increases by +1. Two failures in a row result in
                        complete failure, the results of which are task
                        dependant. A fumble counts as a normal failure, and
                        so increases the fumble chance.

                        singing, playing a musical instrument or writing a
                        book. You are not so much competing against some
                        challenge, but being compared to others. As a rough
                        guide though, a roll of 10+ is something bearable
                        whilst a roll of 20+ is something quite decent (of
                        professional quality).

                    <para>
                        A target of 10+ is something bearable, 20+ is something
                        quite decent. Make a single roll for something short,
                        two for something of medium length, and three or more
                        for longer pieces of work. The overall quality is the
                        lowest roll. A full symphony or ballet performance might
                        be five rolls.

                <para>
                    A <e>Technique</e> is a specialisation of a skill,
                    and may provide bonuses or allow some particular
                    special action to be attempted. A skill may have
                    several techniques associated with it, and some
                    techniques can be used with more than one skill.
                    In the latter case, the technique only needs to
                    be purchased once - it can then be used with any
                    skill which uses it, as long as the skill is of
                    sufficient level.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A technique has a cost associated with it, which is
                    the number of experience points which need to be
                    spent to buy it. A level 6 technique costs 6 points
                    to buy. The cost of the technique is also the
                    minimum skill level that must be achieved before
                    the technique can be purchased. If you do not have
                    the required skill at a sufficient level, then the
                    technique can't be bought.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Finally, a technique may have a prerequisite. These
                    are the techniques which must be known before this
                    technique can be learnt.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Some techniques will be based on a skill group
                    rather than a skill. In this case the technique
                    can be purchased when <e>any</e> skill in that
                    group reaches the technique's level, but it can
                    only be used with those skills of sufficient
                    level.

                    <para>
                        Familiarities, Specialisations and Masteries add
                        a layer of complexity to the system but avoid
                        having to need multiple different skills for
                        similar tasks. It would be possible to simple
                        have a <e>History</e> skill, or a <e>Science</e>
                        skill, and ignore specialisations altogether.
                        However, this was viewed as being too unrealistic
                        for the game. Specialisations allow you to buy
                        a default skill which covers all topic areas,
                        and then just a few points in individual study
                        areas.

                    <para>
                        Some skills require <e>Familiarities</e>,
                        which are techniques of a fixed cost for that
                        skill. Such a skill always has a default
                        familiarity, but will list other familiarities
                        which can be purchased.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For example, <e>Driving</e> assumes skill at
                        driving a typical car, but has familiarities
                        for <e>Motorbikes</e>, <e>HGVs</e>, <e>Tanks</e>,
                        <e>Buggies</e> and the like. If you don't have
                        the right familiarity, then you have to default
                        to the standard skill and your rolls are halved.

                    <para>
                        Most familiarities will be 2 points, though for
                        complex skills they might be 4 points.

                    <para>
                        Many knowledge skills allow <e>Specialisations</e>.
                        Normally, the difficulty of a knowledge task is
                        based on how specialised a bit of knowledge
                        is. Knowing when the <e>Civil War</e> started is
                        a specific bit of knowledge from late English
                        history, so might be difficulty 30.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If you were specialised in <e>English History</e>
                        or <e>Military History</e>, or <e>17th Century</e>
                        then it becomes easier, maybe difficulty 20. For a
                        specialisation in <e>The English Civil War</e>,
                        such a piece of knowledge is obvious.

                    <para>
                        Different specialisations will tend to focus the
                        knowledge you do know. Whilst a success with a
                        <e>English History</e> specialisation will tell
                        you about the politics of the war, and what
                        happened to Oliver Cromwell after the war, a
                        <e>Military History</e> specialisation will
                        give you more information about the battles
                        fought.

                    <para>
                        There is no limit to how many specialisations you
                        can have with a skill, or how broad or narrow they
                        can be.

                    <title>Masteries</title>

                    <para>
                        Masteries are levelled specialisations, and are
                        often used for competitive or artistic skills.
                        For tasks which have an artistic component,
                        they allow you to perform feats with grace, precision
                        and perfection. For competitive actions, they provide
                        specialist training to increasing levels of details.
                        For example, <e>Ballet</e> and
                        <e>Gymnastics</e> are masteries based on
                        <e>Athletics</e>. For <e>Games</e>, masteries can
                        include <e>Chess</e>, <e>Go</e> or <e>Backgammon</e>.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A <e>Mastery</e> has a base cost of 1 point, but can
                        be bought up to any level as per the normal limits for
                        techniques. If you buy a Mastery at level 1, buying it
                        at level 2 costs one extra point - you don't need to
                        buy a whole new technique.

                    <para>
                        Each level of mastery gives you a +1 bonus when
                        attempting tasks related to it. Every 5 levels also
                        gives you a +1 bonus to your attribute.

                    <para>
                        In a competitive skill check, if one person has a
                        lower mastery level than the other, then they suffer
                        a +1 to their fumble chance per level of difference.
                        Furthermore, when a success is won by the side with
                        the highest mastery level, they can select to either
                        not lose their advantage, or to force a level of
                        fatigue on their opponent.

                    How large a creature is can be measured in a number of
                    ways - height, length and mass being the common criteria.
                    In <s>Yags</s>, the <t>Size</t> attribute is a measure
                    of the creature's capacity to absorb damage, and how easy
                    it is to hit. In general, the <t>Size</t> of a creature
                    will increase logarithmically with its mass - every +5
                    increase in <t>Size</t> represents a ten fold increase
                    in mass.

                <para>
                    Adult humans range in <t>Size</t> from 4 (a small, slim
                    woman) to 6 (a heavyweight boxer or stereotypical Norse
                    warrior). Anything other than the default of 5 represents
                    the extreme edge of human variation. The biggest effect
                    it has is to provide a little bit more (or less) capacity
                    to resist damage. The default character generation rules
                    also put upper and lower limits on <t>Strength</t> for
                    noticeably large or small characters.

                    Each point of <t>Size</t> allows a creature (including PCs)
                    to take one wound before dying. A warhorse can take about
                    twice as much damage as a man, an elephant about 3 times.
                    The details are a bit more complex (small weapons have less
                    effect on large targets) however, and a full description of
                    how wounds and damage works is left for the <s>Combat</s>
                    article.

                <para>
                    <e>Vehicles</e> and other constructs are actually treated a
                    little differently from creatures, in that their <t>Size</t>
                    is actually based on the volume of the vehicle, rather than
                    its mass. Obtaining real-world figures for the mass of animals
                    is quite simple, but volumes are rarely given. Finding the
                    volume of a vehicle or building is relatively straightforward,
                    but finding a sensible value for its mass can be hard
                    (especially when a vehicle's mass can change drastically
                    depending on whether it is empty or loaded). However, creatures
                    and vehicles should approximate to the same <t>Size</t> for any
                    given size. A <t>Size</t> 5 vehicle is assumed to be one cubic
                    metre, again increasing by a factor of 10 for each +5.

                            over long distance. Moving this far in combat
                            counts as an action, and restricts what else the
                            character can do - see the combat article for full

            <para>
                There are eight core skills in <tm>Yags</tm>, which are
                called <e>Talents</e>. These are known by virtually all
                characters (at least, human ones), since they represent
                basic ability. These skills are described in the general
                skill lists, but what follows is a very detailed look
                at how these skills can be used.

                It should be noted that the following is rules heavy, and

                hard and fast rules (even more so than normal). A lot of
                what is described are core activities - such as running,
                fast talking, spotting things and the like.

                ability of 6 (3 x 2) - an average roll of 17. A skill check
                of <e>moderate</e> difficulty will be failed 65% of the

                    ropes - these are all tasks for which the <e>Athletics</e>
                    skill is vital. It covers a wide range of athletic,
                    acrobatic and gymnastic feats, including running,
                    swimming, jumping and climbing. It can provide bonuses
                    in combat, but only if you specialise in certain acrobatic
                    styles of fighting.

                        Generally, if you want to run then you don't need to
                        make a skill check. However, sometimes life has a
                        habit of throwing obstacles in your path which can end
                        up testing your skill to the limit. How fast you can

                        Racing across clear terrain with nothing in your way
                        is considered trivial, and you don't need to make a
                        skill check to succeed. On the other hand, trying to
                        dodge through crowds of people on a broken and icy
                        footpath can require a lot of skill and luck. If the
                        path is not clear and easy, then an

                        each round. The difficulty is modified by how fast
                        you are moving - halved if moving carefully, doubled
                        if running and tripled if sprinting.

                            slower, but reduces the number of rolls and hence
                            the chance of fumbling.

                    Hurling a spear into your enemy, chucking a grenade
                    through a doorway, catching a ball or juggling
                    several all come under the <e>Throw</e> skill.

                    <e>Throw</e> is generally based on <t>Dexterity</t>.
                    If throwing at someone, then it's considered an
                    attack and they may get a dodge plus the difficulty
                    will be modified by range (+1 per metre for typical
                    objects). A doorway is about difficulty 10 to throw
                    something through, a window 15, a car window about 20.

                    Catching something like a ball, which was thrown to
                    you, is about 10, modified by +1 for each point the
                    thrower missed you by on their attempt to throw.

                    Some things are limited by the type of technology available.
                    Limits affect both equipment that can be purchased, and also
                    what skills can be learnt. In some cases, a skill may exist
                    in different time periods, but be used quite differently.

                            Electronics and medicine really start to revolutionise
                            society, and the beginnings of space exploration. It
                            wasn't until TL 7 (1972 to be precise) that anyone

                            TL 9 and beyond represent science fiction, so
                            exactly what technology is available will depend

                        <para>
                            By default, TL 9 is assumed to be relatively hard
                            SF. Miniaturisation of computers, greater capability
                            of phones, human cloning and genetic screening and
                            more compact power sources are probably the main

                            be more space based development. TL 9 will go on to
                            at least 2050, maybe 2100 depending on the pace of
                            development. Technology beyond that is impossible to

                        Technology levels of 9+ will be very campaign dependant.
                        Generally, 9 - 10 can be viewed as Cyberpunk style of
                        science fiction, with limited space travel and most
                        stories happening on Earth.

                        societies in SF like <e>Babylon 5</e>, <e>Blakes 7</e> or
                        the <e>Honor Harrington</e> series would be of this level.

                    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
                    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
                    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
                    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
                    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
                    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
                    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
                    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
                    your programs, too.

                    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
                    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
                    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
                    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
                    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
                    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
                    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
                    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
                    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
                    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
                    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
                    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
                    rights.
                </para>

                <para>
                    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
                    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
                    distribute and/or modify the software.

                <para>
                    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
                    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
                    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
                    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
                    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
                    authors' reputations.

                <para>
                    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
                    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
                    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
                    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
                    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

                    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
                    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
                    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
                    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

                <para>
                    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
                    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
                    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
                    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
                    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

                <para>
                    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
                    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
                    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
                    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
                    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
                    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
                    along with the Program.
                </para>

                <para>
                    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
                    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
                </para>

                <para>
                    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                </para>

                <para>
                        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
                        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
                </para>

                <para>
                        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
                        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
                        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
                        parties under the terms of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
                        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
                        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
                        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
                        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
                        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
                        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
                        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
                        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
                        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
                </para>

                <para>
                    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
                    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
                    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
                    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

                    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                    collective works based on the Program.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
                    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
                    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                    the scope of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
                    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
                    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
                </para>

                <para>
                        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
                        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
                        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
                </para>

                <para>
                        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
                        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
                        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
                        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
                        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                        customarily used for software interchange; or,
                </para>

                <para>
                        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
                        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
                        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
                        received the program in object code or executable form with such
                        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
                </para>

                <para>
                    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
                    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
                    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
                    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
                    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
                    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
                    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
                    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
                    itself accompanies the executable.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
                    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
                    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
                    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
                    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
                </para>

                <para>
                    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
                    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
                    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
                    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
                    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
                    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
                    parties remain in full compliance.
                </para>

                <para>
                    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Program or works based on it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
                    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
                    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
                    this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
                    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
                    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
                    circumstances.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
                    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
                    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
                    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
                    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
                    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                    impose that choice.
                </para>

                <para>
                    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
                    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
                    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
                    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
                    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
                </para>

                <para>
                    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
                    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
                    address new problems or concerns.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
                    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
                    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
                    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
                    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
                    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
                    Foundation.
                </para>

                <para>
                    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
                    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
                    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
                    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
                    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
                    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                <para>
                    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
                    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
                    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
                    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
                    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
                    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
                    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
                    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

                    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
                    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
                    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED

                    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
                    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
