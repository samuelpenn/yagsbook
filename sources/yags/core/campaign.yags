            <title>Character Progression</title>

            <para>
                After character generation, characters will rarely stay
                static, for they will gain further experience in the world
                as long as they stay alive. In <tm>Yags</tm>, a lot of
                character progression is meant to be in the form of
                intangible benefits - contacts, information, resources and
                completion of goals.
            </para>

            <para>
                Characters though will gain experience in the form of
                increased skills and abilities. How quickly they do so
                however depends on the type of campaign being run. A
                few ideas are given below.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Simple Progression</title>

                <para>
                    The simplest progression system is to give each
                    player character 1-3 experience points per session,
                    with possibly a cap of no more than 1 point being
                    put on a single skill.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Exact number can depend on anything from achievements
                    to roleplaying, and may be the same across the group
                    or awarded individually. It is often simplest to give
                    a group award, with the possibility of a bonus point
                    for outstanding achievement.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Experience points are spent as they are in character
                    generation, with characters raising the skills and
                    techniques they wish to improve. GMs may wish to limit
                    improvement on skills which have actually been used,
                    or which could have been learnt.
                </para>
            </sect2>

            <sect2>
                <title>Seasonal Progression</title>

                <para>
                    Similar to <e>simple progression</e>, this provides
                    characters with experience every fixed period of game
                    time. This works well for games were PCs have a full
                    time occupation, but who do something exciting once
                    a year.
                </para>

                <itemlist order="strict">
                    <item name="Knights">
                        PCs are knights who have their own manor, or who
                        serve another Lord. Yearly events may be fixed,
                        partaking in tournaments or going off to war
                        after the harvest is in.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Scholars">
                        The PCs work at a university or similar establishment
                        which requires them to do field work now and again.
                        This may be ideal for acheologists in a Pulp campaign,
                        or ghost hunters in a modern horror.
                    </item>
                </itemlist>

                <para>
                    Such progression tends to be relatively slow, so may
                    be best for campaigns where characters begin as either
                    <e>Skilled</e>, <e>Exceptional</e> or <e>Heroic</e>.

            <title>Skill Distribution</title>

            <para>
                The <tm>Yags</tm> character generation system is meant to
                be used to design <e>Player Characters</e>, the results
                which come out of it shouldn't be taken as a representative
                sample of the sort of people that are found in the campaign
                world. This is especially true if a high level campaign
                is being run with heroic level characters.
            </para>

            <para>
                NPCs will tend to have the skills necessary for their jobs
                and not much more, this will often mean a score of 4 in
                their primary skill, with maybe some 2's for related skills.
                The majority of people with have 3's in all their
                attributes, and no advantages or disadvantages. Depending
                on the type of profession they are in, they will have in
                the region of 20-40 skill points.
            </para>

            <note title="Optimised NPCs">
                <para>
                    PCs tend to be optimised to make best use of the game
                    rules, but this doesn't mean that all NPCs should be.
                    In reality, people learn what they can when they need
                    it, and more importantly their 'job' is rarely going
                    to be the most important thing in their life.

        <sect1>
            <title>Experience</title>

            <para>
                Experience is gained during an adventure. The amount depends
                on how quickly the GM wants characters to advance.
            </para>

            <para>
                Experience can be assigned to specific skills, or can be
                open, allowing the player to place them as desired. It is
                suggested that three to five skills are given a point of
                experience - those skills which have been used extensively
                are likely candidates. However, skills in which a character
                has a score of zero should also be granted experience if
                they have been used.
            </para>

            <para>
                For high skills, those above five, experience should only
                be awarded if the skill has been used in a way that
                stretched the character's knowledge. A character with a
                weapon skill of 10, who fought a few peasants, probably
                didn't learn anything new.
            </para>

            <para>
                Finally, from zero to two experience should be awarded
                for roleplaying, and goal achievement. This experience
                can be placed by the player, on any skills or attributes
                they may have had an opportunity to improve (either through
                use, or practise in the odd spare moment).
            </para>
        </sect1>

        <sect1>
            <title>Study</title>

            <para>
                Generally, once an adventure has been completed,
                the characters will not rush directly into the
                next one. Time will be spent healing, resting
                and generally being 'normal'. This time, which
                may range from a few days to several months (or
                even years) can also be usefully spent in training
                and study.
            </para>

            <para>
                There are three ways of improving skills during
                this down time. The first way is through self
                development. This is cheap and easy, but there are
                limits how much someone can learn by themselves.
                The second method is to find someone willing to
                teach the skill. This can be expensive, since the
                teacher's time will have to be bought. The third
                way is to read from books. Only knowledges can
                be learnt this way, but it can be much cheaper
                than personal tuition.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Self Development</title>

                <para>
                    If a character wishes to spend time by himself
                    trying to improve a skill, then they may do so,
                    as long as there is a realistic chance of being
                    able to improve this way. It is not possible to
                    just sit down and learn <i>Ancient History</i>
                    for example, without some source to study from.
                    Likewise, learning to swim in the middle of a
                    desert could be tricky.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Most physical skills can be learnt through self
                    development. Craft skills may be learnt if the
                    right tools and raw materials are at hand to
                    practise with.

                    Each week spent in individual study gives a
                    roll to gain experience. The
                    <i>Experience from Study</i> table shows the
                    target difficulties required to gain one
                    experience point on the skill being learnt.
                    The higher the skill, the harder it is to

                <para>

                    disadvantages the character may have.

                        to pick up the basics of a skill very quickly.
                        If a character has a skill of zero, and it's
                        a relatively simple skill, and the GM allows,
                        a character can gain one experience point after

                <para>
                    While individual study and training is possible, it
                    is generally quicker to find someone who knows more,
                    and persuade them to teach their skills. However, this
                    can be expensive, plus just because someone knows a
                    skill, doesn't mean they know how to teach it well.

                <para>
                    Teachers (and, as it happens, all sources of knowledge)
                    have a <i>quality</i>. The quality is what multiplies
                    the student's intelligence when making an experience
                    gain roll. When studying alone, the quality is
                    effectively two. Obviously, any teacher who provides
                    a quality less than three is worse than self-study,
                    if the skill can be self taught.

                        skill. For every 10 points above the target
                        difficulty for gaining experience, a further point
                        of experience is gained.

                    <para>
                        It is possible for a teacher to teach multiple
                        students at a time. Each doubling of the number
                        of students reduces the quality of the study by
                        one however. So, 2-3 students would reduce the
                        quality by one, 4 - 7 students by three and so on.

                <title>Learning from Books</title>

                <para>
                    Studying from a book is similar to study under a
                    teacher. The book has a quality, which rates how
                    quickly knowledge is improved, and also a level,
                    which limits which skill level can be obtained.
                    Books, though cheaper than hiring a teacher full
                    time, are limited to only being able to teach
                    knowledges.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each book is written about a single subject (skill),
                    for a certain level of student. A book about obscure
                    magical theory may be invaluable to an archmage, but
                    quite incomprehensible to a young apprentice.
                </para>
                <para>
                    As before, the quality gives the intelligence
                    multiplier for the experience gain roll, and one roll
                    is allowed for each week of study with the book.
                    However, the book quality is modified by the difference
                    between the level of the book, and the skill level of
                    the student. Every point of difference gives a -2
                    penalty to the quality of the book.

                    <para>
                        In order for a book to exist for it to be learnt
                        from, a book needs to be written. Anyone with
                        knowledge of a subject can write a book on that
                        subject, but a skill in <i>Author</i> is needed
                        for the book to be comprehensible. As with the
                        Teach skill, this gives the quality of the work.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The level of the book is chosen by the author, up
                        to a maximum level of the authors skill score - 3.
                        It takes one week to write a book of level 1 or
                        less. It takes 3 weeks for a level 2 book, 6 weeks
                        for a level 3 book and so on. Books of high level
                        are extremely rare.

                    <para>
                        Note that this time to write a book assumes lack
                        of modern writing aids such as word processors
                        and the like. Such things can greatly help how
                        quickly a book can be written.

                            If an author stops writing a book before it
                            is finished, then the book has a level equal
                            to that possible to have achieved in the time
                            spent so far. The quality of the book is
                            dimished however. Each two levels short (or part)
                            the book is from the original planned level,
                            the quality is reduced by 1.

                            It is possible to rush a work, though it will
                            be of lower quality. If the quality is reduced
                            by one, the book is finished in three quarters
                            the usual time. Reducing the quality by two,
                            will finish the book in half the time. Fractions

                    Attributes can be raised with experience at three
                    times normal cost. To raise an attribute from four to
                    five would cost 15 experience points.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Attributes can also be raised with study and training.
                    A whole month of training is required in order to
                    improve an attribute. Training may involve physical
                    exercise, practising skills based on the attribute,
                    or reading. Whether the character has suitable access
                    to training materials is up to the GM. Training
                    intelligence for example might require access to books
                    to improve general knowledge, as well as meditation
                    and mental exercises to improve recall and problem
                    solving.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For all attributes other than <e>Will</e>, the
                    character must make a will check at the end of the
                    month against a difficulty of 5 * current level.
                    If it is successful, the attribute gains one experience
                    towards it (remember it is still at three times cost).
                </para>

                <para>
                    For improving Will, use the lowest of empathy and

                    Size cannot be raised by either training or experience.

                Time within the game can pass quicker or slower than
                real time. Where combat is concerned, time is measured
                in rounds (each approximately six seconds long). Where
                long distance travel is concerned, time is measured in
                either days, or watches, depending on how detailed the
                GM wants to be. A watch is equivalent to about 4 hours.
