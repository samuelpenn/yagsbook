                You are familiar with the rules of a given sport, and
                have experience with playing it. This technique should
                be taken once per sport you have experience with. Not
                having the technique means that you don't have knowledge
                of the rules (unless it's a very common game), and halve
                your skill roll when playing it.

                at Professional (4), Expert (6), Champion (8) and
                Master (10). Each lower level technique must be bought
                before the next can be. In a contest of skills between
                two people playing a sport, the one with the highest
                level technique has the advantage. Each rank lower a
                person is, increases their fumble chance by +1. Each
                rank higher, increases the chance of automatic success
                by +1 (e.g., on a '20', '19+', '18+' etc).
