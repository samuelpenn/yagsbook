            <para>
                Provides experience in the maintenance and design of a
                particular type of computer system. Allows networks to
                be configured and optimised, users to be managed and
                file systems and services to be configured.
            </para>

            <para>
                Without this technique, you will find it very hard to
                perform any type of computer administration, and the
                difficulty of any such tasks is doubled.

            <para>
                Knowledge of how to break security on computer
                systems, gain passwords and otherwise compromise a
                system's security. If you have this technique, then
                you can halve the difficulty of any tasks related to
                trying to compromise the security of a computer system.

            <para>
                You have experience with examining computer systems
                for hidden or deleted files, examining logs for
                signs of messages or other evidence. You can also
                use this knowledge to hide information on a system
                so that it cannot be retrieved. Note that though
                encrypted information can be found, you may not be
                able to decrypt it.

            <para>
                Knowledge of encryption and decryption software and
                methodology. Experience with such makes it much easier
                when trying to access encrypted data. This technique
                covers practical experience of using cryptographic
                software, not necessarily the theory.

            <para>
                You are specialised in an engineering discipline.
                This is a generic specialisation for the Engineering
                skill. You can take this as many times as you want,
                each time with a different specialisation.

            <para>
                You can specialise in a branch (civic, electrical,
                mechanical) or a topic area (aircraft, boats,
                computers, communication, cars, power plants,
