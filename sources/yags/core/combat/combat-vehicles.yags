            <title>Vehicles and Constructs</title>

            <para>
                For the most part, adventures in Yags will revolve around
                people and sometimes animals. Objects such as vehicles and
                buildings exist, but only as part of the backdrop, or as
                mechanisms to get from one event to another.
            </para>

            <para>
                Occassionally however, such things become a focal point
                of the game, and it becomes useful to know a bit more about
                how vehicles and buildings fit into the world as described
                by <e>Yags</e> - especially if the are used in combat
                situations.
            </para>

            <para>
                These rules cover the description and use of vehicles
                within the game. Also covered are buildings and other
                non-living things. The generic term used is <e>Construct</e>.
                Also covered are the use of large vehicle mounted and
                infantry support weapons. Most characters will never need
                to worry about these, even in modern campaigns, but the
                occassional scenario will call for their use.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Scaling Vehicles</title>

                <para>
                    <e>Yags</e> uses a generic <t>Size</t> attribute for
                    all creatures within the game, and this is extended
                    to cover vehicles as well. Since <t>Size</t> is
                    logarithmic, it will rarely get above 20 for ground
                    vehicles, it will generally be below 100 (even objects
                    such as the <e>Death Star</e> or
                    <e>Skylark of Valeron</e>). This does lead to a degree
                    of imprecision at the higher levels, but at that point
                    a large level of abstraction is probably a good thing.
                </para>

                <note title="Vehicle Scale">
                    <para>
                        <e>Vehicles</e> are treated somewhat differently
                        to characters and creatures, and are considered to
                        be at a different <e>Scale</e> for purposes of
                        damage. If this wasn't done, then vehicle weapons
                        and armour would be in the 100+ level, and the
                        d20 wouldn't provide much in the way of randomness.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        It also doesn't make sense for a vehicle to suffer
                        from <e>Stuns</e> or <e>Fatigue</e>, so damage
                        tracks are taken slightly differently as well.
                    </para>
                </note>

                <para>
                    A <t>Size</t> of 10 is considered to be a vehicle of
                    10m^3, and each +5 <t>Size</t> increases this by a
                    multiple of 10. <t>Size</t> 10 is more than enough for
                    a family car, <t>Size</t> 15 is adequate for a
                    large tank and a WWII battleship would be in the
                    high twenties.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Weapons and armour have a special <e>Vehicle</e>
                    property - Vc - which mark them as being of Vehicle
                    Scale. Standard weapons do considerably less damage
                    to vehicles, and vehicle weapons pretty much ignore
                    the armour and soak of people.
                </para>

                    <title>Soak</title>

                    <para>
                        A construct will normally have a base soak equal to
                        its size. If it is stronger or weaker than usual
                        then this can vary. The following guide can be used
                        to determine the base soak of a vehicle or building.
                        These are guidelines only, and any values inbetween
                        (or outside) those given can be used.

                        <item target="x0.5" value="Weak.">
                            A very weak object, normally poorly constructed
                            or delibrately designed to be light.
                        </item>

                        <item target="x1" value="Average.">
                            Any typical building or vehicle will have a
                            base soak equal to its size.
                        </item>

                            Object has been designed from the start to be
                            tough and durable. A tank, battleship or bunker
                            will tend to be this strong.
                        </item>

                        <item target="x3" value="Very strong.">
                            A heavily built vehicle, such as the strongest
                            tanks, or a heavily toughened bunker. The entire
                            design of the construct is geared towards making
                            it strong, rather than pretty or fast.

                            materials (TL10+), or one which is designed to
                            do little more than resist damage at the expense
                            of being very space inefficient.

                            but also highly resistant to damage.

                        This is the base soak of the construct, and is not

                    <para>
                        As for characters, vehicles and buildings may be
                        armoured. Many heavily armoured vehicles will have
                        two armour ratings - one for the heavy front armour,
                        and the second for the lighter sides and rear.
                        Most armour on vehicles is considered to be
                        <e>Light vehicle</e>. <e>Heavy vehicle</e> weapons
                        (normally armour piercing weapons, such as HEAT)
                        halve such armour.

                    <title>Damage</title>

                    <para>
                        Vehicles have a single damage track, with a number
                        of states: <e>Okay</e>, <e>Superficial</e>,
                        <e>Medium</e>, <e>Critical</e> and <e>Destroyed</e>.
                        The latter is equivalent to <e>Fatal</e> wounds for
                        characters, and results in the vehicle being
                        rendered completely inoperable.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        All damage is applied to this track, and is of two
                        types - <e>Major</e> and <e>Minor</e>. All vehicle
                        scale weapons cause <e>Major</e> damage to vehicles.
                        Such damage is equivalent to <e>wounds</e> against
                        characters, and is additive.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Character scale weapons may cause <e>Minor</e>
                        damage to vehicles. This is treated like stuns, in
                        that it is non-cumulative. If the damage caused is
                        less than half the current damage, then the attack
                        is ignored. If it is more than half, but not more
                        than the current damage, then one level of damage
                        is caused. If the damage is greater than the current
                        damage, then the total damage is equal to the
                        damage caused.

                    <para>
                        Major damage may cause critical hits against the
                        vehicle. Minor damage is normally superficial.

                    <para>
                        The damage levels for a vehicle are split equally
                        between <e>Superficial</e>, <e>Medium</e> and
                        <e>Critical</e>, with extra levels going to the
                        lower bands first. A size 10 car would have 4
                        levels of Superficial, 3 of Medium and 3 of
                        Critical.

                    <item name="Size">
                        The general size of the vehicle, normally based on
                        the volume. Volume is used instead of Mass (which
                        animal Size is based on) because this is normally
                        easier to obtain for real world vehicles.

                        How good the vehicle is at resisting damage. This

                        How fast the vehicle can move, in metres/round.
                        This is normally the top speed of the vehicle
                        in metres per round. This is about 2.2 times
                        (or twice) the miles per hour speed.

                        The threshold at which the vehicle suffers
                        criticals. It is equal to the number of damage
                        levels the vehicle has in its Superficial
                        level.

                    Listed below are some sample vehicles, showing a range
                    of sizes and capabilities from the modern day and
                    recent history.

                <para>
                    Weapons which have a property of <e>Vehicle (Vc)</e>
                    completely ignore the <e>Soak</e> of standard targets
                    unless they are in Heavy armour. This means that the
                    total soak roll is always zero for these targets.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Standard targets with heavy armour have their total
                    soak roll halved. If the vehicle weapon is also heavy,
                    then heavy armour is treated as normal armour, and the
                    soak total is zero.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Any target which has Vehicle armour halves the damage
                    from standard weapons, and all damage done is Minor.
