            <title>Missile Combat</title>

            <para>
                Missile combat includes all forms of ranged combat, from
                throwing sticks and stones to spears, bows, modern firearms,
                RPGs and laser weapons. Missile combat happens at the same
                time as melee combat (in initiative order). As with
                everything else, all attacks are sort of simultaneous - if
                your target moves behind a solid wall before your attack
                comes up in the initiative, you can still shoot at them,
                but they may count as being in partial cover, since they
                were in cover for some of the round.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Initiative</title>

                <para>
                    As with melee weapons, you may choose whether to act
                    <e>fast</e>, <e>normal</e> or <e>slow</e> when attacking
                    with a missile weapon. Unless otherwise stated, all
                    attacks are assumed to be normal.
                </para>

                    <title>Snap shots</title>

                    <para>
                        You can take a quick shot without any aiming, which
                        is a <e>fast</e> action. This doubles the effective
                        distance to the target. Special manoeuvres may be
                        used unless otherwise stated.

                    <title>Careful shots</title>

                    <para>
                        If you take your time over a shot, then your actions
                        are <e>slow</e>. This has the advantage of halving
                        the effective distance to the target. You may combine
                        this with special manoeuvres unless otherwise stated.

                    <title>Drawing a weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        As for melee weapons, a missile weapon can be drawn
                        and used in the same round. Regardless of what else
                        you are doing, drawing a weapon means that any attack
                        with it will be a snapshot, and will be slow.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        You also suffer a -5 penalty to the attack, plus a
                        further -5 per reach of the weapon.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Rate of Fire</title>

                    <para>
                        If a weapon has a <e>Rate of Fire</e> greater than
                        one, then it is possible to make multiple attacks
                        in a single round, as long as all the attacks are
                        against a single target. For every full 4 points of
                        skill you have, one extra attack can be made. You
                        cannot make any defence or move actions in a round
                        when firing multiple shots like this. The
                        <e>Recoil</e> of the weapon will take into account
                        all penalties (recoil, reloading etc) for subsequent
                        shots.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If the weapon is listed as being <e>Automatic</e>
                        or <e>Semi-automatic</e>, then use the rules for
                        these types of weapons instead of the above rules.
                        Generally, the above only applies to bolt-action
                        rifles.

                    <title>Reloading Weapons</title>

                    <para>
                        Some weapons must be loaded before they can be
                        fired. Loading a weapon takes time, which may
                        be several rounds. The weapon may be fired as
                        a slow action on the round after loading has
                        finished.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Such weapons will be marked as <e>Lo-X</e>, to
                        denote the load time. If <e>X</e> is zero, then
                        the weapon may be loaded and fired in the first
                        round, though as a slow snap shot. Bows are
                        examples of Lo-0 weapons.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If you have zero skill in the right weapon skill,
                        then the load times are increased by one or
                        doubled (whichever is greater). Modifiers (such
                        as <e>techniques</e>) which bring the load time to
                        less than zero may ignore delays due to reloading
                        weapons.
                    </para>

                    <sect4>
                        <title>Magazines and reloading</title>

                        <para>
                            Some weapons may have a magazine capacity and
                            a reload time. In this case, the reload time is
                            to reload the magazine - reloads between each
                            shot is not required.

                <title>Reach and Close Combat</title>

                <para>
                    Missile weapons, like melee weapons, have a
                    <e>reach</e> defined for them. Though they are not
                    meant for use in melee combat, the reach determines
                    how slow the weapon is to aim, and how clumsy it is
                    in close quarters battle. A low reach is generally
                    good, though high reach weapons tend to be more
                    accurate.
                </para>

                <note title="Close Quarters Battle">
                    <para>
                        These rules for missile weapon <e>reach</e> are
                        meant to enforce the advantages of smaller weapons,
                        especially firearms. Without them there is little
                        reason not to take the biggest, deadliest, weapon
                        with you wherever you go. Realistically however, the
                        move to shorter firearms is because of the problems
                        faced in CQB.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        There is greater complexity in keeping track of
                        where people are if these rules are used however,
                        so in simpler games it may be better to ignore
                        them.
                    </para>
                </note>

                <para>
                    Missile weapons with a high reach are not effective
                    against very close targets, either because they are
                    hard to aim, or just because the defender can easily
                    knock the weapon aside or dodge within its length.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Very close ranges are divided into three different
                    threat bands for missile attacks - <e>Close</e>,
                    <e>Melee</e> and <e>Move</e>.
                </para>

                        Grappling, or fighting with reach 0 melee
                        weapons, such as fists or knives.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Melee (Reach 1)">
                        Melee combat is anytime the target is fighting
                        you with a melee weapon (of any reach), or if
                        they are within 3m.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Move (Reach 2)">
                        Move range is within the target's combat move (not
                        your combat move). For most people this is 6m.

                <para>
                    If a missile weapon has a reach <e>less</e> than the
                    associated threat band above, then the weapon is
                    unaffected by combat at that range. A pistol can be
                    used normally against anyone at Melee distance or
                    beyond, a typical SMG (reach 1) at move distance
                    or greater.

                        If a weapon has a reach equal to the threat
                        band, then they are <e>impaired</e>. The target
                        always gets their full defence (even against
                        firearms), and the weapon does not get its
                        attack bonus.

                        If the weapon has a reach greater than the threat
                        band, then it is <e>crippled</e>. All the penalties
                        of being <e>impaired</e> apply, plus all attacks
                        are automatically <e>slow</e>, and the attack roll
                        is halved.

                        Any weapon listed as being a firearm is a ranged
                        weapon firing a very fast projectile, though lasers
                        and similar weapons also count. You cannot use other
                        missile skills with firearms and vice versa

                        in which case non-bullet proof armour is ignored

                        An <e>automatic</e> weapon is capable of firing
                        in burst mode, up to its maximum rate of fire.
                        The size of a burst will be 10 bullets unless
                        otherwise noted, and distance to target is
                        effectively doubled. Full rules for automatic

                        If an automatic weapon can be fired in semi-automatic

                        shots a round, but cannot be fired in burst mode.
                        A number of shots may be fired against a single

                        normal attack (range is not doubled), but
                        any wounds caused are doubled.

                        Armour piercing rounds are very good at getting

                        All armour is halved (or ignored, if already halved),
                        but damage caused is mixed.

                        damage to a human will tend to vapourise air
                        between the gun and the target, giving a lightning
                        like effect and a clap similar to thunder.

                <para>
                    As for melee combat, there is a base difficulty needed
                    to hit a target. Unlike in melee combat though, this is
                    modified by the range to the target, and environmental
                    factors such as wind and visibility.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For a human sized target, the base difficulty is 15, as
                    for melee combat. For smaller or larger targets, the
                    difficulty changes however.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For every point of size that the target is larger than
                    you, there is -3 to the difficulty. For every point of
                    size they are smaller than you, there is +3 to the
                    difficulty.

                    There are two range factors to take into account - the

                    <para>
                        The distance increment of a weapon is a measure of
                        how accurate it is over range. Improvised thrown
                        weapons have an increment of 5m, bows 10m and modern
                        sniper rifles about 50m.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        At distances up to the increment, there is no modifier
                        to the difficulty to hit the target. At ranges greater
                        than this, and each multiple of the increment, there
                        is a +5 to the target difficulty.

                    <para>
                        For a bow with an increment of 10m, there is no
                        modifier to the target difficulty up to and including
                        10m. Up to 20m, there is a +5 modifier, up to 30m a
                        +10 modifier and so on.

                        The distance modifier adds to the (possibly halved)
                        defence roll of the target (or to 15, whichever is
                        greater).

                        targets beyond long range. Short range is the most
                        effective range of the weapon - at ranges beyond
                        this there are penalties to damage and accuracy.
                        The range band is independent of the distance
                        increment, and doesn't effect the target difficulty
                        directly.

                        Weapons such as bows, crossbows, hurled weapons and

                        hit targets at medium or long range. Targets at
                        short range can be hit on a more or less flat
                        trajectory. So, for example, it is not possible to
                        fire at long range down a low corridor.

                        the range is needed in height. Firing a long bow at
                        a target 200m away, requires 50m of height, since
                        this is at long range. The attack bonus of the weapon
                        is also lost at medium and long range.

                        Firing at a stationary target on a firing range is one

                        is another thing entirely. There are a lot of
                        environmental factors which can make it harder to
                        shoot at a target, and they can all stack together
                        to make life difficult.

                        Each negative factor increases the effective distance

                        band (the short, medium, long classification).
                        This stacks with using either a <e>careful shot</e> or

                        the stability of the weapon is improved, reducing
                        recoil and increasing effective range.

                        and halve (round down) its recoil penalty.

                        takes a round to do, halves the recoil penalty and
                        increases short range for automatic fire by 50%.

                        Thrown weapons may be dodged or blocked just as

                        try to step out of the way. However, thrown weapons

                            solid between you and the attack. This is a

                    <title>Firing into melee</title>

                    <para>
                        Firing into a melee combat is rarely a good idea,
                        but sometimes it is done anyway. If the target of
                        a missile attack is in close combat with anyone
                        else, then the fumble chance of the attack is
                        increased by three for each extra person. Firing
                        into a melee involving six people, would give a +18
                        to the fumble chance, meaning the attacker has a
                        chance of hitting a random target if the d20 roll
                        is anything other than a 20.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The chance of fumbling can be modified if the
                        target is much larger or smaller than the
                        obstructions. This is left for the GM to
                        decide, but if two humans are fighting a 20m
                        long dragon, then it is suggested that no
                        penalty is applied.

                    <para>
                        A fumble in this situation means that a random
                        target is hit. It is possible to hit the 'right'
                        random target. Chance of hitting each target
                        should be based on size, and ideally distance from
                        the intended target. In reality, just assigning
                        equal chance to everyone is a simple approach.

                        If someone is wrestling with the intended target,
                        add +5 to +15 to the fumble chance, depending on
                        how bad a shot it is. In all cases, a luck point
                        can be spent before hand to negate, or at
                        least reduce, the chance of hitting a friend.

                        If you are behind cover, then the difficulty to hit

                        the cover is hard or soft, and how much of you it
                        actually covers. Cover also provides extra
                        protection against automatic fire - every +10 bonus
                        that cover provides (including from being crouched
                        or prone) reduces the 'automatic hit' chance by 1.

                    a single Yags round. In order to try and keep things
                    quick and simple, Yags uses an abstracted system for
                    automatic fire.

                        Automatic fire is inherently inaccurate at anything
                        other than very short range, and Yags tries to
                        simulate this. It can also be very effective at
                        suppressing people though, so a random element is
                        thrown in to make even highly skilled characters
                        think twice at charging bad guys with automatic
                        weapons.

                    Automatic fire is divided into <e>bursts</e> which
                    normally consist of 10 bullets. Some heavy weapons will
                    have larger bursts, but you may never choose to fire
                    less than a full burst unless there are fewer bullets
                    left in the gun. Every burst is considered to be one
                    attack.

                <para>
                    The effective size of the burst defines how big a bonus
                    is obtained from using automatic fire, however it is
                    reduced at anything other than close range. Up to 10%
                    of the short range of the weapon, the effective burst
                    size is equal to the number of bullets fired. Over 10%,
                    and each multiple of this, halve the effective number
                    of bullets (round down). A gun with a short range of
                    400m, would have an effective burst size of 10 out to
                    40m, 5 out to 80m, 2 out to 120m and 1 to 160m. Any
                    greater range than this and all bullets are assumed to
                    miss.

                    Firing weapons in burst mode also doubles the effective

                        Instead of firing at a single target you may aim a

                        lots of people. You do not get to choose who you
                        hit, instead targets are randomly determined, though

                        with a single bullet. After resolving that hit, roll
                        against for the next target. Up to 3 targets may be

                        For bursts of 5 or more bullets, there is a chance
                        of an automatic hit against a target, regardless
                        of their defence roll. This is due to the
                        unpredictable nature of automatic fire, which can
                        make it dangerous. On an automatic hit, the target
                        does <e>not</e> count towards the normal maximum of
                        targets.

                        a burst (even if they aren't hit), they must
                        make a <t>Will</t> check at 20 or suffer a shock
                        penalty to initiative of -5. Each burst beyond
                        the first adds +10 to the difficulty, and each
                        level it is failed by gives a further -5 shock.

                        If the weapon has a recoil penalty, then each shot

                        If the penalty is -5, then the 2nd shot is at -5,

                        be done before the first shot. Each shot is

                        <para>
                            If you want to fire two pistols at the same
                            time, then treat it as if firing multiple shots.
                            However, shots from your off-hand are at -10,
                            and the distance for <e>all</e> shots is doubled.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Recoil penalties apply to each gun independently,
                            but your skill still limits the total number of
                            shots you can make.

                    <para>
                        When you choose this manoeuvre you fire one or more
                        automatic bursts at a single target. Each subsequent
                        burst suffers double the recoil penalty of the weapon,
                        but you can keep on firing bursts until you run out
                        of bullets or want to stop.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Use the rules for automatic fire at a single target.

                    <para>
                        A <e>full auto</e> attack will, for most weapons,
                        empty the clip. When firing on full auto, the
                        weapon fires a number of <e>burst attacks</e>
                        over an area. Use the automatic fire rules for
                        firing at an area.

                    <para>
                        Each subsequent burst may be at a different area,
                        though the areas must be next to each other (or
                        overlap).

                        <para>
                            If you wish, you can fire over a 60 degree arc
                            instead of a 30 degree arc. Halve the effective
                            number of bullets, but otherwise treat it as
                            automatic fire.

                        <para>
                            This is suppressive fire when you aren't looking
                            at what you're firing at. Consider yourself to
                            have an attribute of zero, but you can count as
                            being completely in cover (rather than 90% cover).
                            You must declare the number of bursts before
                            firing any.

                            If you have <e>blind fighting</e>, then you can

                    <para>
                        Some modern automatic firearms have an option to
                        only fire 3 shots in a single burst. If selected,
                        this is treated as a single attack which does not
                        use the automatic fire rules, instead on a successful
                        hit any wounds are doubled. When making an aimed
                        shot, a three round burst counts as a single shot.

                    <para>
                        You may make as many 3 round bursts as you could
                        normally make automatic bursts.

                    Over the centuries, mankind has tried many ways of

                    <title>Shotguns</title>

                    <para>
                        Shotguns typically fire a cloud of pellets at the
                        target which disperse over a cone shaped volume. This
                        gives them a greater chance of hitting the target, but
                        damage is greatly reduced at range. Shotguns are the
                        most common type of weapon with a <e>Cone</e> blast
                        effect.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Cone-effect weapons are rated as Co-X, where 'X' is
                        a measure of how quickly the projectiles spread out and
                        gives the number to roll to get an automatic hit.
                        A typical shotgun will be Co-18.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Up to <s>short</s> range, any wounds or stuns caused are
                        doubled. This is because all the projectiles are likely
                        to hit the target, and cause multiple injuries.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        At <s>medium</s> range, damage is no longer doubled,
                        and also drops a damage type as the projectiles spread
                        out. However, there is a chance to automatically hit
                        the target. If the die roll for the attack equals or
                        exceeds the <e>Cone</e> rating of the weapon, then the
                        target is hit, regardless of the actual hit or dodge
                        rolls.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        At <s>long</s> range, the cone rating is raised by 2
                        (e.g., Co-18 becomes Co-20) and the damage changes are
                        as per medium range.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Note that shotguns (and other cone weapons) suffer all
                        the usual rules for firing at medium and long range, and
                        also for fighting in close quarters.

                            instead, in which case the weapon loses its
                            <e>Cone</e> effects completely.

                            though it means that at medium and long range
