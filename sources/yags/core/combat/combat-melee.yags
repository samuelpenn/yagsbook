            <para>
                The basic rules for combat describe a simple and fast
                system for resolving fights. This section describes
                melee combat in more detail, providing more options for
                characters, and describing how to handle some situations
                in more detail.

                <title>Fighting Styles</title>

                <para>
                    For melee combat there are two skills which cover
                    pretty much everything - <e>Brawl</e> for fighting
                    without weapons, or with improvised or small weapons,
                    and <e>Melee</e> which covers all proper melee weapons
                    (swords, maces, spears, shields and exotic weapons
                    such as flails).
                </para>

                <para>
                    Different weapons, and different styles of fighting,
                    require some specialist knowledge in order to get the
                    most out of them, and this is represented by certain
                    <e>techniques</e>. Many common thugs or militia may
                    well lack these techniques, but they will definitely
                    be known by anyone with formal training.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Techniques will tend to be based either on the type
                    of weapon, or the style of combat. Unarmed combat
                    styles (such as Jujitsu or Savate for example) are
                    also treated as techniques (which come off <e>Brawl</e>).
                    The difference between a street brawler and a martial
                    arts expert is that the latter will know more techniques,
                    but both will use the <e>Brawl</e> skill.

                    <para>
                        The basic <e>Brawl</e> skill involves simple punching,
                        kicking and grappling. It also covers the use of simple
                        or improvised weapons such as a knife, dagger or broken
                        bottle.

                    <para>
                        Any weapon listed with a type of <e>brawl</e> can
                        be used with this skill. Other types of weapons can
                        be used but their attack, defence and damage
                        bonuses are halved, all attacks are slow and the
                        fumble chance is increased by 1.

                    <para>
                        <e>Brawl</e> can also be used to <e>grapple</e> foes
                        rather than cause simple damage. <e>Grappling</e> is
                        described later.

                    <para>
                        Melee covers fighting with 'proper' weapons,
                        generally those with a reach greater than zero.
                        Any melee weapon, however exotic, can be used with
                        this skill, though some have basic attributes which
                        render them difficult or even dangerous to use if
                        the right techniques aren't known.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When using the <e>melee</e> skill, the following

                            If using a second weapon, half (round up) of the

                        can be used at the same time if fighting with a spear

                            These weapons are designed to be used one handed
                            by themselves, or possibly in combination with a

                            A shield is designed to be used in combination
                            with a single handed weapon. They provide a
                            large defensive bonus if they are used properly,
                            but otherwise can be clumsy.

                            <e>Great weapons</e> require two hands to use.
                            They tend to be large, and designed to cut,
                            pierce or smash armour. They can be good offensive
                            weapons but can lack defensive capability in
                            unskilled hands.

                        <para>
                            Longshaft weapons tend to consist of a blade or
                            point mounted on a long stick of wood. Spears
                            and pikes are the most common form of longshaft
                            weapons. They are best when used in formation.

                        <para>
                            Chain weapons consist of a handle and 'head'
                            connected by a flexible chain or rope. They can
                            be tricky to use and often have a high fumble
                            chance.

            <sect2>
                <title>Advanced Weapons</title>

                <para>
                    Each weapon has a number of properties which
                    represents how effective it is. These give a bonus
                    to a character's skill checks in combat. All
                    bonuses are zero or positive - no weapon gives a
                    negative adjustment to combat actions.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Creatures which have natural attacks have their
                    own combat modifiers, depending on the nature of
                    their natural weapons. Generally, these are worse
                    than those of man made weapons. Size, reach and
                    sharpness all have a say in how effective natural
                    weapons are for a given type of creature.

                <sect3>
                    <title>Weapon attributes</title>

                    <para>
                        The following apply to all weapons.

                            This provides a bonus to hit the target. It is
                            a measure of accuracy and also weight and
                            reach.

                        <item name="Defence">
                            This adds to the character's defence roll. It
                            represents parrying, but also how good the
                            weapon is at keeping the enemy away from the
                            user.

                            The weapon's damage modifier adds to the damage
                            done by the attacker. This property also
                            includes the type of damage done - either stun,
                            mixed or wounds.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Reach">
                            The reach of the weapon is how far forward it can
                            be effectively used. Reach gives an advantage
                            against shorter weapons, though can be a
                            disadvantage in confined spaces.

                            The minimum strength needed to use a weapon. A
                            weapon being used two handed adds 50% (round up)
                            to the user's effective strength for this. If
                            the user's strength is one point below that
                            required, there is a -5 penalty to
                            attack and defence. Two points below, this
                            penalty is -15. Weaker characters cannot use the
                            weapon at all.

                            do not normally count as martial weapons,

                        Some weapons have special properties which affect

                        The <e>Reach</e> of a weapon is a measure of its
                        length and effectiveness at engaging targets at a
                        distance. Spears are the best reach weapons, knives
                        and daggers are amongst the worst.

                        Long weapons are best in open spaces, especially

                        they can actually be a hindrance to the user.

                <para>
                    There are some actions which are very unwise to perform
                    in a combat situation, since they leave you open to an
                    attack from your foe. Within <e>Yags</e>, these are
                    handled as <e>free strikes</e>.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <e>Free strikes</e> always occur immediately before the
                    action that triggers them. If an action triggers
                    multiple <e>free strikes</e>, then all are merged into
                    a single <e>automatic strike</e> (see below). If an
                    action triggers strikes from multiple foes, then each
                    foe handles their strikes independently (in initiative
                    order).
                </para>

                <para>
                    Some actions may trigger a <e>counter strike</e> after
                    it has been completed. These are similar to
                    <e>free strikes</e> except they occur after the action.
                    Multiple <e>counter strikes</e> are ignored - a single
                    foe will only get one <e>counter strike</e> against
                    you for a single given action. However, multiple foes
                    may each get a strike.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Some circumstances allow you to ignore free strikes.
                    In this case, the number of strikes against you is
                    reduced by one. An <e>automatic strike</e> becomes a
                    <e>free strike</e>, two <e>counter strikes</e> become
                    a single one (which effectively means no effect).

                        This does not affect your other actions that round,
                        and you may make multiple <e>free strikes</e> in a

                        Each item of armour has a protection value, and a load.

                    When declaring your action at the start of the round,
                    you may declare a <e>stance</e>. Stance affects how

                    but other stances are possible. Sometimes stance is

                    <para>
                        It is normally considered a full action to put a
                        weapon away. Dropping a weapon is free however,
                        so a weapon may be dropped, another one drawn
                        and an attack made in the same round. In this case,
                        any defence rolls are made with the new weapon at
                        the normal penalty, even if you are attacked before
                        your initiative comes up.

                    <para>
                        One weapon may be put away, and a second drawn
                        in a single round, though other actions cannot
                        be taken that round except for defences, at a
                        penalty equal to 5 + 5 x (total reach of both
                        weapons).

                    <para>
                        If you got a really bad initiative, you may spend
                        the round re-rolling it. This takes the entire
                        round, and you may not move, attack nor defend
                        that round. At the end of the round, roll initiative
                        again and keep whatever is rolled.

                    <para>
                        If your initiative was zero for any reason (e.g., due
                        to shock) then your new initiative roll is halved
                        just like all your other rolls.

                        If things are going really bad, then you may want
                        to start considering retreating from combat. If
                        you use the <e>defensive stance</e>, and give
                        ground to your attacker, you can gain a bonus to
                        your defense rolls.

                    <para>
                        You may retreat up to a number of metres equal to
                        your agility, and each metre gives a +3 bonus to
                        your defence roll. However, you may not make any
                        attacks that turn.

                    <para>
                        If the situation allows it, then you may attempt
                        to take advantage of the scenery to give yourself
                        an advantage in an attack by performing a
                        <e>stunt</e>. A <e>stunt</e> may be as simple as
                        leaping straight at your foe, or as complex as
                        jumping over a banister or swinging on a rope.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The base difficulty of the stunt depends on how
                        useful a stunt it actually is. An
                        <y:agility>athletics</y:agility> check is made,
                        and if it succeeds it can be immediately followed
                        by the attack roll. If it fails, then the attack is
                        considered to be a fumble. Stunts are always
                        <e>slow</e> actions.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A successful stunt gives you a +5 to attack or
                        damage per level of success of the stunt. The
                        difficulty of the stunt is up to the GM.

            <title>Melee Manoeuvres</title>

            <para>
                Manoeuvres are special actions which anyone can try to
                perform. They must normally be declared at the time that
                the attack is declared, and often require a <e>good</e> or
                better attack success. Failure to achieve the required
                level of success results in failure.
            </para>

            <para>
                The available melee manoeuvres are listed below. The
                required level of success is provided in parenthesis
                after the name of the manoeuvre. If a stance is also
                listed, then that stance must be used when making the
                attack.
            </para>

            <para>
                Some manoeuvres cause a level of fatigue to be gained.
                The fatigue is gained immediately after the manoeuvre
                completes (only on success), so any fatigue penalties
                do not affect the manoeuvre itself.

                        be declared. The defender has the option to either
                        to step aside, or to stand their ground - in either
                        case they get a <e>free strike</e> against you if

                Fighting from horse back can be tricky, but for a
                skilled rider it can be a big advantage. Warriors who
                wish to fight from horseback should look at the
                <e>mounted combat</e> and <e>mounted archery</e>
                techniques, since these mitigate most of the problems.
            </para>

            <para>
                If a character wishes to make a melee attack from the
                back of a mount, then they must make an
                <y:agility>riding</y:agility> check at difficulty 15.
                One roll is required each round that the character has
                declared any attacks or defenses.
            </para>

            <para>
                Failure of the riding roll means that the character
                becomes unstable and loses their attack. Make a second roll
                at the same difficulty to remain on the horse. If the
                rider is not using saddle and stirrups, then both
                difficulties are increased by 5.

            <para>
                The character's ride skill adds to attack rolls made
                from horseback, against either infantry or other
                mounted opponents. Characters with the <e>mounted
                    combat</e> technique add this bonus to <e>all</e>
                their melee rolls (initiative, attack, defence and
                damage), as well as not needing to make ride rolls
                each round.

                    Missile combat however suffers no penalty if the

                    mounted, and the distance is not doubled.

                    A <e>mounted charge</e> is a special kind of attack
                    that uses a lance from horseback, and can only be
                    used after at least a full round of charging. This
                    can only be done from a trained warhorse.

                    On a successful mounted attack, damage is done with
                    a bonus equal to the strength of the mount (on top
                    of any bonuses due to the <e>ride</e> skill).
                    Furthermore, for each wound dealt, a stun is dealt
                    as well from the shock of the attack.

                <para>
                    It is always possible for someone on foot to strike
                    directly at the mount. Mounts are often quite large
                    however, and some may be more resistant to damage
                    than the rider.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Any animal that has a <t>Size</t> which is 10 levels
                    higher than the attacker (i.e., 15+ if attacked by
                    a <t>Size</t> 5 human) causes all damage against it
                    to be reduced by one level of effectiveness -
                    <e>wounds</e> become <e>mixed</e>, <e>mixed</e>
                    becomes <e>stuns</e> and <e>stuns</e> become
                    <e>ineffective</e>.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The reverse is also true - if a creature's <t>Size</t>
                    is at least 10 levels higher, then the damage is
                    increased in effectiveness. Stuns become
                    mixed, mixed becomes wounds. Wounds are already as
                    deadly as it is possible to be, so are unaffected.

                <para>
                    <e>Very</e> large animals, those which have a

                    opponent, cause damage to be shifted by two categories.
                    In this case, stuns do no damage if shifted down.
