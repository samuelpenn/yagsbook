            <para>
                Missile combat includes all forms of ranged combat, from
                throwing sticks and stones to spears, bows and guns.

                <para>
                    As for melee combat, there are a number of different
                    styles which make use of a particular skill. The
                    talent <e>Throw</e> is similar to the <e>Brawl</e>
                    skill in that it can be used as a default for all
                    other ranged combat skills.

                        The <e>Throw</e> skill is the missile equivalent
                        of the <e>Brawl</e> skill, and is used for all
                        simple missile weapons, including rocks, bottles,
                        knives, axes and slings.

                        not normally use the <e>throw</e> skill causes
                        all range penalties to be doubled.

                        not default to <e>throw</e>. A character without
                        any skill takes twice as long to load a crossbow

                    <para>
                        Some weapons must be loaded before they can be
                        fired. Loading a weapon takes time, which may
                        be several rounds. The weapon may be fired as
                        a slow action on the round after loading has
                        finished.

                    <para>
                        Such weapons will be marked as <e>Lo-X</e>, to
                        denote the load time. If <e>X</e> is zero, then
                        the weapon may be loaded and fired in the first
                        round, though as a slow action. Bows are
                        examples of Lo-0 weapons.

                    <para>
                        If you have zero skill in the right weapon skill,
                        then the load times are increased by one or
                        doubled (whichever is greater).

                <title>Size of Target</title>

                <para>
                    As for melee combat, there is a base difficulty needed
                    to hit a target. Unlike in melee combat though, this is
                    modified by the range to the target, and environmental
                    factors such as wind and visibility.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For a human sized target, the base difficulty is 15, as
                    for melee combat. For smaller or larger targets, the
                    difficulty changes however.

                <para>
                    There are two range factors to take into account - the
                    <e>range increment</e> of the weapon, and the <e>range
                    category</e> it is being fired at.

                <sect3>
                    <title>Range Increment</title>

                    <para>
                        The range increment is a measure of how accurate the
                        weapon is at range. It is given as a distance, and
                        each multiple of this distance gives a +5 modifier
                        to the target difficulty.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A long bow has a range increment of 25m. Targets
                        less than 25m away have no modifier. Targets which
                        are 25m or further away have +5 to the difficulty,
                        50m or further have +10 etc.

                    <para>
                        Shooting a long bow against a <e>Colossal</e> target
                        at 200m, would be difficulty 30 (-10 for size, + 40
                        for the range).

                        The range category is either <e>short</e>,
                        <e>medium</e> or <e>long</e>. A weapon cannot hit
                        targets beyond long range. The range category
                        affects the performance of the weapon, though not
                        the difficulty to hit. In most cases, this is just
                        the damage the weapon does.

                    <para>
                        Weapons such as bows, crossbows, hurled weapons and
                        slings must be aimed on a ballistic trajectory to
                        hit targets at medium or long range. Targets at
                        short range can be hit on a more or less flat
                        trajectory. So, for example, it is not possible to
                        fire at long range down a low corridor.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        At medium range, there must be ample height available
                        equal to one tenth the range. At long range, quarter
                        the range is needed in height. Firing a long bow at
                        a target 200m away, requires 50m of height, since
                        this is at long range.

                    <para>
                        Because of the angle the short will come down at, it
                        is not possible to fire through narrow gaps, such as
                        a window or arrow slit at long range - the archer
                        can hit the window, but not someone behind the
                        window. At medium range, it is possible to hit
                        someone immediately behind a window or similar gap,
                        but it would not be possible to fire through a
                        window to hit someone on the other side of the room.

                    <para>
                        Other modifiers to the target difficulty for
                        missile weapons are as follows. All modifiers are

                        Missile attacks can be dodged, but not parried
                        unless the defender has a shield, in which case
                        they get the defence bonus of the shield, but not
                        of any other weapon they are using.

                    <para>
                        The main issue with defending against missile
                        attacks is that the defender must be aware that
                        they are being made. If a character is in the
                        middle of a melee, then an awareness roll may be
                        required to notice an archer taking aim.

                    <para>
                        Firing into a melee combat is rarely a good idea,
                        but sometimes it is done anyway. If the target of
                        a missile attack is in close combat with anyone
                        else, then the fumble chance of the attack is
                        increased by two for each extra person. Firing
                        into a melee involving six people, would give a +10
                        to the fumble chance, meaning the attacker has a
                        chance of hitting the wrong target if the d20 rolls
                        less than 12.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The chance of fumbling can be modified if the
                        target is much larger or smaller than the
                        obstructions. This is left for the GM to
                        decide, but if two humans are fighting a 20m
                        long dragon, then it is suggested that no
                        penalty is applied.

                        A fumble in this situation means that a random
                        target is hit. It is possible to hit the 'right'
                        random target. Chance of hitting each target
                        should be based on size, and ideally distance from
                        the intended target. In reality, just assigning
                        equal chance to everyone is good enough.

                        how bad a shot it is. In all cases, a luck point
                        can be spent before hand to negate, or at
                        least reduce, the chance of hitting a friend.

                        A stunt may be as simple as leaping straight at

                    Wrestling and brawling covers any unarmed hand to hand
                    combat which is more complex than simply hitting the
                    other guy. Since all such attacks generally require
                    getting in very close to the target, they generate a
                    <e>free strike</e> against the attacker.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The attacker generally uses an agility based brawl
                    attack, against the defender's brawl defence. If the
                    defender has weapons, then they may defend with their
                    weapons except that they use their <e>brawl</e> skill
                    rather than normal weapon skill. Also, every point of
                    reach of their weapon gives them a -5 penalty.

                <para>

                    (grapple, trip, overrun etc). Each extra level of
                    success on the initial attack gives a +5 bonus to

                        The defender can choose to either break free
                        or grapple back. In either case, both make a
                        contested brawl check, using either strength or
                        agility (normally whichever is highest).

                        otherwise the winner is assumed to have grabbed
                        and held the other, giving them a -1 to agility,
                        dexterity and strength for further skill checks

                        An overrun is an attempt by an attacker to move
                        through a defender, either by forcing them out the
                        way or by knocking them over. An attempt at an
                        overrun counts as not using a weapon, so may
                        generate a <e>free strike</e> unless the attacker
                        has a medium or larger shield.

                    Fighting from horse back can be tricky, but for a
                    skilled rider it can be a big advantage. Warriors who
                    wish to fight from horseback should look at the
                    <e>mounted combat</e> and <e>mounted archery</e>
                    techniques, since these mitigate most of the problems.

                <para>
                    If a character wishes to make a melee attack from the
                    back of a mount, then they must make a agility riding
                    check at difficulty 15. One roll is required each round
                    that the character has declared any attacks or
                    defenses.

                <para>
                    Failure of the riding roll means that the character
                    becomes unstable and looses their attack. A second roll
                    at the same difficulty to remain on the horse. If the
                    rider is not using saddle and stirrups, then both
                    difficulties are increased by 5.

                    The character's ride skill adds to attack rolls made
                    from horseback, against either infantry or other
                    mounted opponents. Characters with the <e>mounted
                    combat</e> technique add this bonus to <e>all</e>
                    their combat rolls (initiative, attack, defence and
                    damage), as well as not needing to make ride rolls
                    each round.

                        As for melee combat, and missile combat requires a
                        riding roll if firing from horseback. All penalties
                        due to range are also doubled.

                        Missile combat however suffers no penalty if the

                        mounted, and range penalties are not doubled.

                        that uses a lance from horseback, and can only be
                        used after at least a full round of charging. This
                        can only be done from a trained warhorse.

                        of any bonuses due to the <e>ride</e> skill).
                        Furthermore, for each wound dealt, a stun is dealt
