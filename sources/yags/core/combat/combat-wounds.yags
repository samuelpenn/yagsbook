            <title>Damage, Stuns and Wounds</title>

            <para>
                Damage can take many forms, but it all comes down to one
                of the three types - either <e>wounds</e>, <e>stuns</e> or
                <e>mixed</e>. Related to damage is <e>fatigue</e> and
                <e>exhaustion</e>, as well as <e>shock</e>.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Wounds</title>

                <para>
                    Wounds represent serious injuries that penetrate the
                    skin and potentially affect internal organs. They
                    can lead to bleeding, infection and death. Wounds
                    heal over a period of many weeks.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Wounds are caused by lethal weapons such as swords,
                    spears, maces, arrows and bullets. Anything which can
                    penetrate the skin and/or break bones and cause
                    damage to internal organs causes <e>wounds</e>.
                </para>
            </sect2>

            <sect2>
                <title>Stuns</title>

                <para>
                    Stuns represent cuts and bruises which will generally
                    heal naturally within a few days. They will rarely
                    lead to death and are generally caused by non-lethal
                    attacks such as punches, whips or rubber clubs.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The big difference between <e>wounds</e> and <e>stuns</e>
                    is that <e>stuns</e> aren't cumulative. If you receive
                    more stuns than you currently have, then your <e>stun</e>
                    total is set to the amount you've received. Unless you
                    receive less than half what you currently have, you
                    always gain at least one stun however.
                </para>

                <title>Mixed Damage</title>

                <para>
                    <e>Mixed</e> damage is half way between <e>stuns</e> and
                    <e>wounds</e>. Weapons which can damage internal organs,
                    but which don't tend to penetrate far can cause <e>mixed</e>
                    damage. This includes knives, wooden clubs and other
                    light weapons.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <e>Mixed</e> damage causes half stuns (rounded up) and
                    half wounds (rounded down), though stuns are considered
                    cumulative.
                </para>
            </sect2>

            <sect2>
                <title>Fatigue</title>

                <para>
                    A character's fatigue is measured in a similar way to
                    wounds, though the number of fatigue levels they have
                    is based on their health, ranging from OK to
                    Exhausted. If a character becomes Exhausted then they
                    must immediately rest.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Fatigue is normally short term, and can be lost in
                    minutes. Exhaustion is gained through long term
                    effort or lack of sleep, and can only be lost through
                    a night of sleep. Exhaustion and fatigue stack
                    together on the same track - two levels of
                    fatigue and two levels of exhaustion add up to
                    four levels on the fatigue track, and count as a
                    single penalty as if the character had four levels
                    of either.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is suggested that fatigue is kept track of on the
                    character sheet by crossing off fatigue levels
                    with a single line, and exhaustion with a cross.
                    Exhaustion is always <e>first</e> on the line,
                    and last to be lost.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you are <e>exhausted</e> through a combination of
                    fatigue and exhaustion, and gain more fatigue or
                    exhaustion, then one level of fatigue is changed to
                    be exhaustion.
                </para>
            </sect2>

                <title>Shock and Pain</title>

                <para>
                    Some types of damage can cause high levels of shock
                    and pain which have an immediate but temporary effect
                    on you, reducing your ability to act until you take
                    the time to recover your senses.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you suffer <e>shock</e>, then your current initiative
                    total is reduced, down to a minimum of zero. Changes to
                    your initiative don't come into play until next round.
                    The change affects both declaring actions, and the
                    actions themselves.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If your initiative drops to 0 (the minimum), then all
                    your actions are <e>slow</e> and all rolls are halved,
                    though it is possible to act normally for a round if
                    you take a level of <e>fatigue</e>.
                </para>

                <para>
                    At any point, you can spend a whole round doing nothing,
                    in which case you may re-roll your initiative. If your
                    initiative is currently zero, then this roll is halved
                    unless you take a level of <e>fatigue</e>. Alternatively,
                    you can spend two rounds re-rolling your initiative,
                    since the second roll won't be halved.
                </para>

                <para>
                    You won't normally receive <e>shock</e> from attacks,
                    but fire and chemical attacks can cause it, as may a
                    few martial arts forms.

                <title>Size effects on Damage</title>

                <para>
                    Damage against a creature which is 10 size points
                    or more higher than the attacker have the damage
                    type shifted down by a category (so <e>wounds</e> become
                    <e>mixed</e>, <e>mixed</e> become <e>stuns</e> and
                    <e>stuns</e> become <e>ineffective</e>).
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the target is 15 size points larger, then the damage
                    is shifted down two categories. These effects make
                    larger weapons (spears and great swords for example)
                    more effective against large creatures, since they
                    offset this to some extent.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The converse is also true. If the attacker is 10 size
                    points or more larger than the target, then the damage
                    type is shifted up one category, and up two categories
                    if they are 15 size points higher. There is no damage
                    category above <e>wounds</e>, so such damage is
                    unaffected.

                <title>Vehicle Scale Weapons</title>

                <para>
                    The use of <e>Vehicles</e> is generally abstracted in
                    <s>Yags</s>, since the focus is on interactions between
                    people. However, there are times when you may find
                    yourself facing a tank (or driving one) and need to know
                    what affect your puny pistol (or sword) will have on
                    thick chobham armour.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Vehicles are treated as a separate <e>scale</e>, and so
                    a given value of soak or damage for a vehicle isn't
                    equivalent to the same value that a person may have.
                    Vehicle damage is either <e>Major</e> or <e>Minor</e>,
                    being roughly equivalent to <e>wounds</e> and <e>stuns</e>
                    for people. However, both types of vehicle damage are
                    treated the same if applied to fleshy people.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If a vehicle scale weapon is used against a character
                    scale target (e.g., a fleshy person), then the character
                    receives <s>no</s> soak roll, unless they are fully
                    protected with heavy armour. In the latter case, then
                    their entire soak roll is merely halved.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Character scale weapons against vehicles have their
                    damage roll halved, and only cause <e>Minor</e> damage.
                    Damage may also be shifted down due to the Size of
                    the target. Character scale weapons shifted down
                    have no effect against large vehicles (there is no
                    <e>ineffective</e> damage against vehicles).
                </para>

                <para>
                    If vehicle damage is shifted up a category against
                    characters, then heavy armour is ignored, but there
                    are otherwise no extra effects.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Most man-portable firearms are considered to be Size 5.
                    Anti-vehicle weapons (such as a tank's main gun) are
                    normally Size 10 regardless of the size of the firing
                    vehicle. Naval guns and artillery are Size 20.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A full discussion of vehicles can be found in the
                    <e>Vehicles</e> article. It should be noted that the
                    size of the weapon or target does not affect whether
                    it is <e>vehicle</e> or <e>character</e> scale. An
                    elephant is character scale, a motorbike is vehicle
                    scale. Likewise, a tank may mount a character scale
                    machine gun, and an infantryman can carry a vehicle
                    scale LAW rocket.

                    <title>Explosive damage</title>

                    <para>
                        <e>Explosive</e> damage tends to affect all targets
                        within an area, with less damage being caused to
                        targets at the edge than near ground zero. When
                        weapons cause explosive effects, they are listed as
                        <s>Ex-X</s>, where <s>X</s> is the base radius of
                        the explosion in metres. Explosive devices, such as
                        grenades, are generally lethal due to a mixture of
                        concussion and fragmentation effects. For simplicity,
                        there are combined into a single damage roll.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Out to the base radius, targets receive the full
                        force of the explosion, and suffer <e>wounds</e>.
                        Out to twice the radius, targets receive only
                        mixed damage (but the damage rating is itself
                        unchanged) and out to triple the radius
                        <e>stuns</e> are caused.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Each multiple beyond that, reduce the number of
                        stuns caused by a factor of 5 (round down). The
                        damage roll isn't modified, just the number of
                        stuns.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A simple 10g explosive charge of TNT does +20 damage
                        and is considered a <e>Size 5</e> attack. Each
                        doubling of the explosive amount does a further +10
                        damage. The base radius is equal to one twentieth of
                        the damage (e.g. Ex-1 at 10g, Ex-2 at 40g, Ex-3 at 160g).
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        An explosive designed for fragmentation effects will
                        have a larger radius. For a typical modern
                        fragmentation grenade, multiply the blast radius by
                        ten.

                            The above assumes small explosions, normally
                            those designed to be effective against
                            characters. Larger explosions are treated as
                            <e>Vehicle</e> weapons, and hence cause
                            vehicle scale damage. Anything which is the
                            equivalent of a pound or more of TNT is
                            generally considered to be vehicle scale.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            A vehicle scale explosion does <e>Major</e>

                            will only damage out to twice the radius).

                            Taking cover from an explosive is generally the
                            best course of action. A successful dodge roll
                            allows you to move a distance equal to your

                    It is generally a good idea to get your wounds tended

                    check at a base target of 10. The target is modified by
                    the total of your <e>wound</e> and <e>stun</e>

                    be 10 + (10 + 5)/2 = 18. If you are <e>beaten</e>
                    and <e>fatally wounded</e>, then check difficulty
                    would be 50.
