            <title>What Is Yags?</title>

            <para>
                <s>Yags</s> is a roleplaying game system designed for
                games in a number of different genres, from fantasy to
                modern and science fiction. It's goal is to enable
                <e>Cinematic Realism</e>, covering the range from
                low fantasy or horror where fairly mundane people are
                thrown into abnormal situations, up to heroic larger
                than life characters who are trained to manage against
                overwhelming danger through skill, wits and luck.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is up to the <e>Game Master</e> to decide on the type
                of campaign that will be played by selecting one of
                four starting character levels: <e>Mundane</e>,
                <e>Skilled</e>, <e>Exceptional</e> or <e>Heroic</e>.
                These determine the number of points a player has to
                build their character and the maximum levels they can
                start with on their attributes and skills.
            </para>

            <para>
                This choice does not limit how powerful and/or skilled
                characters can become over time, they merely represent
                how good characters are at the start of the game.
            </para>

            <note title="Cinematic Realism">
                <para>
                    The core rules of Yags try to portray a model
                    of the world that gives results that are similar to
                    what we might expect in the real world, allowing
                    players and GMs to second guess the results of actions
                    based on their own common sense. This does mean that
                    getting shot is bad, and being outnumbered in a melee
                    is not a good thing. Most characters will be forced
                    into being very careful if they are going up against
                    organised enemies.
                </para>

                <para>
                    However, highly skilled characters can sidestep some
                    of these difficulties, and act more like Hollywood
                    action heroes - awesome, but not completely super
                    human. You can't dodge a bullet, but you know how
                    to make best use of cover.
                </para>
            </note>

            <para>
                <e>Yags</e> aims for something close to realism, whilst
                still allowing for heroic characters. Even the greatest
                hero can be taken out by a single bullet or thrust of a
                sword, but they win against the enemy hordes through
                clever tactics, high skill and possibly some luck.

                <title>The Rules in Brief</title>

                <para>
                    <e>Yags</e> uses a single d20 for all die rolls. When
                    making a skill check, you determine which attribute and
                    skill to use, and roll <s>Attribute</s> x <s>Skill</s>
                    + 1d20. Most professionals will have an attribute of 3
                    and a skill of 4, so will be rolling 12 + 1d20.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A very easy task has a target difficulty of 10, a
                    moderate task 20, a difficult task 30+. You must roll
                    the target difficulty or higher in order to succeed.
                    Difficulties can get as high as 100 or more. In some cases
                    you may need to make a check just against an attribute
                    (for example, a <e>Health</e> check to remain conscious)
                    where no skill is involved.
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Attributes</title>

                    <para>
                        There are eight primary <e>attributes</e> that all
                        characters have, and these define your raw talent.
                        Raising attributes after character generation may
                        be difficult or impossible, depending on the
                        campaign, and though a high attribute won't make
                        you automatically good, it is necessary in order
                        to be very good.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The attributes are <t>Strength</t>, <t>Health</t>,
                        <t>Agility</t>, <t>Dexterity</t>, <t>Perception</t>,
                        <t>Intelligence</t>, <t>Empathy</t> and <t>Will</t>.
                    </para>
                </sect3>


                <sect3>
                    <title>Skills</title>

                    <para>
                        Skills are abilities which are gained through study,
                        experience and training. There are 8 basic skills
                        (talents) which all being at a score of 2, all other
                        skills are assumed to start at zero unless stated
                        otherwise for your background.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A skill of 4 is considered to be a trained
                        professional, 6 is an expert, 8 is elite and 12+
                        is a true master of the profession. Skills above
                        15 are pretty much unheard of, though there is no
                        theoretical limit to how high skills can go.
                    </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Techniques</title>

                    <para>
                        Techniques are specialities bought within a
                        particular skill. They enable you to perform actions
                        that would be impossible or hard without it, or
                        grant a bonus in certain situations (sometimes to
                        related skills).
                    </para>
                </sect3>
            </sect2>

            <sect2>
                <title>Setting and Style</title>

                <para>
                    <e>Yags</e> does not try to cover all possible settings
                    in one set of rules. What is provided here is a wide
                    range of skills and background options, but only enough
                    to cover the 'real world'. There are no options for
                    magic, since how magic is learnt and used can differ
                    from setting to setting. Likewise, there are no skills
                    to cover piloting space craft or operating energy shields
                    or matter transmitters, since again how these work
                    differs between science fiction settings. Individual
                    world books will contain the unique information necessary
                    to build characters for these settings.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Finally, it is up to the Game Master to decide on the
                    level of the campaign - <e>Mundane</e>, <e>Exceptional</e>
                    or <e>Heroic</e>, and any other limits in place on
                    the choice of characters and backgrounds.

            <title>Your Character</title>

            <para>
                Building a character for <e>Yags</e> is a relatively
                straightforward process. There are many choices
                available however, and as always it helps to have a good
                idea of your character concept before you start. The
                setting of the campaign will tend to limit this, and
                your GM may have some suggestions as to what type of
                characters will find a useful role to play.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Yags</e> is point based, and the number of points you
                get to spend depend on the level of the game that the
                GM will be running. You get three point pools to spend
                from - <s>Attributes</s>, <s>Experience</s> and
                <s>Adavantages</s>. Your first task is to prioritise
                these according to the type of character you wish to
                play. You must choose one pool as your <e>Primary</e>,
                one as your <e>Secondary</e> and the last as your
                <e>Tertiary</e> pool. The Primary pool gets the most
                points to spend, and the Tertiary the least.
            </para>

            <note title="Point Pools">
                <para>
                    The points you get to create a character with are
                    divided into a number of different <e>pools</e>.
                    This division serves two purposes. Firstly, it helps
                    to focus character design into easier to understand
                    chunks. Secondly, it helps to limit possible abuses of
                    the design process by preventing the player from
                    making extreme choices.
                </para>
            </note>

            <para>
                The pools are not necessarily equal, but which are the
                most useful will depend on the type of campaign and
                the type of character that you wish to build.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>The Pools</title>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Attributes</title>

                    <para>
                        Your <e>attributes</e> define the raw potential of
                        your character. A character with good attributes
                        tends to be able to pick up new things reasonably
                        quickly. They can be fit, healthy, intelligent and
                        charismatic. Attributes are difficult or impossible
                        to raise after character generation (depending on
                        the campaign style), so can be more useful long
                        term than experience or advantages.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Hollywood action heroes will tend to have high
                        attributes. A character with high attributes and
                        low skills represents the gifted amateur who learns
                        to quickly supercede their mentors.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When you prioritise attributes, you define both
                        how many extra points you get to spend, and the
                        maximum level any single attribute can be. This
                        is shown as +points/maximum in the tables below.

                    <title>Experience</title>

                    <para>
                        <e>Experience</e> represents skills and knowledge,
                        generally gained through training and real world
                        experience. A character with a lot of experience is
                        probably older than those who lack it.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Academics, scientists and businessmen will tend to
                        have a high experience. These are often the support
                        characters in fiction - less heroic, but providing
                        useful skills in specialised areas.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When you prioritise experience, you define both how
                        many points you get to spend on skills and techniques,
                        and the maximum level of any single skill. As for
                        attributes, this is shown as points/maximum.

                    <title>Advantages</title>

                    <para>
                        Heroes often have some out of the ordinary feature
                        which separates them from normal people.
                        <e>Advantages</e> represent these features. By
                        purchasing advantages, you can make your character
                        special in a certain way, either through extremely
                        good looks, large size, speed or luck.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Advantages also allow you to purchase certain
                        background options, such as wealth or high status.
                        An otherwise normal character can be extremely useful
                        to a group by being able to provide large sums of
                        money to fund their adventures.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When you prioritise advantages, you define how many
                        points of advantages you may buy. You always have the
                        option to purchase a single disadvantage, which will
                        provide you will extra points for more advantages.
                        This may be a '-1' disadvantage which gives you a
                        single extra point, or a '-2' or '-3' which give
                        more points.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For every full 3 points of advantages you are given,
                        you may take an extra disadvantage for further
                        points. Again, it is the number of disadvantages
                        that is limited, not the total value of them.

                <title>The Priorities</title>

                <para>
                    Before you can begin character generation, the GM will

                    the type of characters you will be playing. <e>Mundane</e>
                    campaigns are about mostly normal people, so are suitable
                    for horror games and low fantasy. <e>Exceptional</e>
                    campaigns are about skilled and experienced people, and
                    are suitable for mid-level fantasy or science fiction
                    campaigns. <e>Heroic</e> games are about larger than
                    life people similar to Hollywood action heroes.

                        Mundane campaigns are about normal people in abnormal
                        situations (or even normal people in normal situations).
                        In this type of campaign, characters are somewhat
                        above average, but not significantly so.

                        This level of campaign is suitable for modern horror,
                        or stories about young, inexperienced knights at
                        the start of their careers. There is no reason that
                        characters in such campaigns can't grow to become
                        heroic, but the story is often about their progression
                        rather than what they do once they become heroes.

                        <e>Tertiary</e> level in each of the three categories.
                        Skilled professionals will tend to have <e>Primary</e>

                    Choosing your priorities is best done up front, before
                    proceeding with the rest of character generation.
                    However, it is easy to swap things around later if you
                    do change your mind. With the exception of a small
                    number of cases, each point pool is independant, so it
                    is easy to change things in one area without affecting
                    the other areas.

            <para>
                For player characters, attributes are generally rated on a
                scale of 1 to 10, with human PCs falling within the range
                of 2-8. Anything outside of the range 2-5 however is
                significantly unusual for an adult human, and a typical
                adult will have all their attributes at 3.
            </para>

            <para>
                The number of points that may be spent on buying up an
                attribute depends on the priority you chose for attributes
                and the level of campaign that is being run.

                bonus applies after you have purchased the attribute.
                You may not purchase an attribute to a level that

                        to be nice or nasty, but does affect how well

            <para>
                Skills are those abilities which a character develops
                throughout their life, and tend to change a lot more
                regularly than attributes do.

                How good a character is at a skill is rated as a value
                from zero upwards. A skill of four is acceptable for
                someone wanting to make a living with the skill. Higher
                skills are possible, though skills above six will be

                        standard skills, with the exception that all

                        of at least one. They can rarely be self taught,
                        requiring a teacher or study aid (such as a book)
                        to learn from.

                        Language skills are treated on a scale from

                        like other skills. Instead, the level of skill
                        gives a guide to how much of a conversation a
                        character can understand.

                    <para>
                        In some settings it is normal for the majority of
                        people to have some form of education. Rather than
                        either forcing all characters to buy a suitable
                        number of skills, or giving those skills for free,
                        <s>Yags</s> allows <e>Educated</e> characters to
                        default to an <t>Intelligence</t> check for anything
                        covered by a standard education.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For a 'western' education, it can be assumed that
                        <e>geography</e>, <e>history</e>, <e>science</e>,
                        <e>mathematics</e>, <e>computer operation</e>,
                        <e>drive</e>, <e>religion</e> and <e>politics</e>
                        are covered by this.

                    <para>
                        An <e>Educated</e> character can make an
                        <t>Intelligence</t> test, halved, for any of these
                        skills. The <e>Area lore</e> skill can also be used
                        for general knowledge about society and culture.
                        This level of education is assumed to be 'GCSE'
                        level or equivalent - up to age 16.

                        Further education, up to A'level would be covered
                        by a relavent skill at a level of two. A basic
                        university education would give a skill of about
                        four at time of graduation, possibly with one or two
                        suitable techniques.

                        Some skills have a default - this will generally be
                        one of the <e>talents</e>. If desired, the default
                        can be used instead, but the result (after the die
                        roll) is halved, plus the chance of fumbling is
                        doubled.

                    <para>
                        A default skill may also restrict the type of
                        tasks which are possible. For example, <e>Trade</e>
                        defaults to <e>Guile</e>, but the latter can only
                        be used to barter, and isn't much use if the
                        character needs to know the real value of goods.

                    <para>
                        A few skills have pre-requisites. Before this skill
                        can be purchased at level one, all pre-requisites
                        must be met. A skill like Physics might have a
                        pre-requisite of Mathematics-2 and Science-2 for
                        example, which means both skills must be known at
                        level 2 before buying physics.

                    <para>
                        Further, the main skill may never be more than
                        double the level of any of the pre-requisites. A
                        physicist would have to raise their Mathematics
                        and Science to at least 3, before raising
                        Physics to 6.

                    <para>
                        Under some genres, a skill may be <e>limited</e>
                        by another skill. This concept is mostly limited to
                        knowledge or science skills. When a skill is limited
                        by another skill, the first skill may never be more
                        than half the score of the second.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For example, during the <e>Enlightenment</e>, when
                        Science was being discovered, the Science skill is
                        limited by Natural Philosophy. If a character has
                        a Natural Philosophy of 7, then their Science
                        cannot be higher than 3 (since raising it any higher
                        would make it greater than 3.5). Once the
                        character's Natural Philosophy has been raised to
                        8, then they can begin to raise their Science to 4.

                    <title>Skill Techniques</title>

                    <para>
                        A <e>Technique</e> is a specialisation of a skill,
                        and may provide bonuses or allow some particular
                        special action to be attempted. A skill may have
                        several techniques associated with it, and some
                        techniques can be used with more than one skill.
                        In the latter case, the technique only needs to
                        be purchased once - it can then be used with any
                        skill which uses it, as long as the skill is of
                        sufficient level.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A technique has a cost associated with it, which is
                        the number of experience points which need to be
                        spent to buy it. A level 6 technique costs 6 points
                        to buy. The cost of the technique is also the
                        minimum skill level that must be achieved before
                        the technique can be purchased. If you do not have
                        the required skill at a sufficient level, then the
                        technique can't be bought.

                    <para>
                        Finally, a technique may have a prerequisite. These
                        are the techniques which must be known before this
                        technique can be learnt.

                            then you can spend 4 points to buy

                <para>
                    Techniques represent specialist training in a particular
                    use of a skill. They can provide a bonus in certain
                    situations, or allow you to perform an action which
                    wouldn't otherwise be possible.
                </para>

                <note title="Optional techniques">
                    <para>
                        Techniques can be viewed as an optional part of
                        the game system. They add a lot of flavour and
                        detail to the skill system, and provide a means
                        to differentiate between characters who simply
                        have raw talent (high attributes and basic skill)
                        and those how are highly trained (high skill
                        with a lot of techniques). However, there can be
                        quite a few to keep track of.

                        If you wish a simpler system, then ignoring
                        techniques is perfectly possible without causing
                        major problems. Adding them in later is also
                        possible, simply by allowing players to start
                        purchasing them.

                    <para>
                        The Academic techniques cover the sciences and
                        other areas of knowledge. Generally, each is a
                        specialisation within a subject - so the
                        <e>Physics</e> skill will have techniques for
                        <e>Nuclear Physics</e>, <e>Relativity</e> etc.

                    <para>
                        A specialisation technique halves the difficulty
                        of tasks within the specialisation. If a technique
                        for a specialisation doesn't exist, then make it
                        up. Most academic specialisations are level 4.
                        Those which are for cutting edge specialisations
                        might be 6 or 8.

            <title>Improvement</title>

            <para>
                A central facet of many RPGs is that a character can improve
                as the game progressions. This isn't a universal rule however,
                and it suits some type of fiction better than others. Much
                fantasy fiction revolves around a young, inexperienced hero
                with much untapped potential gaining that experience, and
                becoming a skilled champion in an unfeasably short period of
                time. Modern or science fiction tends to focus on already
                experienced characters who need to use their existing skills
                to survive. There are many examples which go against this
                trend, but it can be a useful distinction to make.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Heroic Experience</title>

                <para>
                    If, as a GM, you wish characters to improve rapidly in
                    their skill sets, then it is suggested that experience
                    is handed out at the end of each gaming session,
                    possibly 1-3 points. Players can use this to improve
                    their character's skills or techniques, at a maximum of
                    1 point on any single skill per session, and possibly
                    limited to skills which could sensibly have improved.
                </para>

                <para>
                    This gives players a lot of control over what skills
                    go up, and will tend to lead to PCs having a few high
                    skills. Note that this does allow characters to go
                    from totally untrained to professional level (4) in
                    10 game sessions - which may be only a few days or
                    few weeks of game time.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Optionally, a point may be granted at the end of each
                    story arc (or at dramatically appropriate moments)
                    which may be spent on attributes. Attributes can be
                    raised in the same way as skills - 1 point per level
                    of attribute you are raising to. This shouldn't amount
                    to more than a few points a year for young characters,
                    or more than a point a year for more experienced
                    characters.

                <para>
                    Alternatively, it may be desired to opt for a slower
                    approach to skill improvement that is somewhat more
                    realistic. This allows characters to pick up
                    experience during down time within the game, rather
                    than from actual adventures.
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Background Experience</title>

                    <para>
                        Characters in a new area may pick up language and
                        area lore skills if they don't already have them.
                        If they have a skill less than 2, they <e>may</e>
                        gain 1 XP towards these skills each week they have
                        an opportunity to learn. If they have a skill of
                        2-3, then they <e>may</e> gain 1 XP each month.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Each week or month of game time, roll a d20, and on
                        a 10+ you gain 1 XP towards the skill. Once the skill
                        reaches 4, it won't improve in this way. This does
                        assume that you are interacting with other people
                        (in the case of language) or exploring (for area
                        lore). If you aren't doing this at all, then no
                        XP will be gained. If you are doing it in a limited
                        way, then you need a 15+.

                        Similar to <e>Background Experience</e>, it can be
                        assumed that you will pick up knowledge related to
                        a job. If you are performing full-time duties which
                        require skill use, then you may pick up experience
                        on the job. Many skills will have multiple skills
                        associated with them, in which case choose the most
                        appropriate, or the lowest skill.

                        As before, you are limited to gaining a skill of 4
                        (professional level) in this way, and it should take

                        It is always possible to gain skill through dedicated

                        often paying them for their time. A training session
                        takes a week for techniques, or if your current skill
                        is less than four. For higher skills, it takes a month.

                        As for other methods of learning, roll a d20 to see if
                        you gain any experience in the trained skill. For
                        techniques or skills less than 4, the target is 10+.
                        For skills up to 7, the target is 15+ and if your

                            grounds would often qualify.

                        When teaching a technique, the trainer must already
                        know the technique. When teaching a skill, the trainer
                        must have a skill of at least 4, and at least half the
                        student's current skill otherwise training is not
                        possible.

                        At the end of the training period, roll a simple d20
                        and on success 1 XP is gained towards the skill or
                        technique. If the roll is 10 or more over the target
                        difficulty, gain 2 XP instead.
