            <para>
                You have friends in powerful places, who may do you
                favours on occasion. They will rarely intercede
                directly on your behalf, but they may provide
                information, or introductions.

            <para>
                Choose a group of people to have the contacts in.
                It may be the underworld, a noble house, a city,
                a profession.

            <para>
                You are allied with a small group of people who will
                sometimes aid you when asked. The smaller the group,
                the more likely they are to aid you. Aid may be in
                the form of information, or direct physical
                involvement.

            <para>
                You have made (or inherited) enemies in the past, and
                they still have a grudge against you. Choose a single
                group or organisation as a long term enemy. The larger
                and more powerful the group, the less likely they are
                to send someone after you.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You have performed criminal acts in the past, and have
                been caught and punished for it. Depending on the
                setting, you have a reputation, criminal record or
                disfigurment resulting from this. People who recognise
                you for what you are will probably react badly to you.
            </para>

            <para>
                The lower cost of this disdavantage is for petty crimes,
                such as small time theft. The higher cost disadvantage may
                include murder or other crimes.

            <para>
                You have a secret in your past which would cause serious
                problems for you if it were found out. It may be a crime
                that you have committed, or a secret of your ancestry
                which you do not want others to know. Revealing the
                secret to the public would make your life very
                difficult.

                You owe favours to a single person who will call them in
                at some point. Repaying the favours should not be a
                great hardship, but will create you an enemy (and maybe
                give you a bad reputation) if you fail to honour your
                debt.

                You start the game poor. What you own will be of low

                little or no spare cash initially, and in a modern

                You cannot afford to just go out and buy anything, and

                a million pounds (including house, cars and savings).
