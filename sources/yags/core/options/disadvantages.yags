            <para>
                You are an albino. Your skin and hair are white and your
                eyes are pink. You risk suffering sub burn in moderate
                sunlight, and may find that others react badly to you due
                to your unusual appearance.

            <para>
                You are fearful and indecisive, and react poorly in combat.
                You are unable to act in the first round of combat. If
                you have surprise, then you do not get any benefit from
                the surprise. A fumbled initiative means that you are
                indecisive for two rounds.

                this point). Arithmetic is very difficult, and estimating

                need to make a <t>Will</t> check at a difficulty of at
                least 20 in order to do so. If you, the player, speaks

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                The addict craves some drug which they need to stave off
                withdrawal symptoms. The cost of the addiction is measured
                by three factors - whether the substance is socially
                accepted (tobacco and alcohol normally are), whether it is
                expensive and/or difficult to get hold of (heroin), and
                whether it has any side effects which affect the character
                in game (alcohol and heroin would, though tobacco wouldn't,
                since the latter's side effects are too long term to have
                any effect in most games).

                Side effects include anything which can be detrimental to
                you during the general course of play. Drinking yourself
                into a stupor most evenings may have less effect on the
                game than being mildly drunk all the time.

                    Your addiction is socially acceptable, reasonably
                    cheap and has few short term side effects. Smoking
                    is an example (you may get negative reactions in
                    some places, but it's not illegal).

                <item target="-3">
                    Your addiction is either not socially acceptable,

                    very, very badly. Heroin is not sociably acceptable
                    and is expensive, but most side effects are long

                Everybody you meet who could be sexually attracted to
                you will be. This may mean they react well to you, but
                in lawless situations it could be dangerous. Even when
                they are treating you nicely, people will view you as
                a sex object rather than as a person with meaningful
                opinions.

                People who aren't sexually attracted to you will view

                Normally the you will automatically fail any attempts to
