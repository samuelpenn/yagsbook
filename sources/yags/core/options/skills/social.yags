        <description>
            <para>
                Etiquette is a knowledge of good manners and social
                behaviour. It is of much greater use amongst the higher
                classes than amongst the peasantry, where no-one really
                cares which fork they use to eat their meal with, as
                long as a meal is there to be eaten.
            </para>

            <para>
                It may be used to know how to address someone of rank,
                how to flirt with a noble Lady without offending her,
                or how to behave at a joust or banquet. It is normally
                based on intelligence, but may use charisma (especially
                for courtly flirting or flattery).
            </para>

            <para>
                Defaults to <e>Charm</e>.

            <para>
                Being able to scare people, either with threats of simple
                physical violence, or by more subtle means. Can either be
                based on strength or charisma.

    <skill name="Politics" type="social">
        <default>Guile</default>

        <description>
            <para>
                The skill of dealing with the intrigues of a political
                court. With it, it is possible to find out relationships
                within the court, and to obtain information from people, or
                even to spread information without it being obvious that
                the plotter is trying to spread information.
            </para>

            <para>
                Note that politics is as much knowledge of the local
                political situation as it is the ability to 'play' it.
                Knowledge of who the powerful people are, and what their
                strengths, weaknesses and allegiences are is gained
                with this skill.

        <description>
            <para>
                <e>Streetwise</e> is similar to <e>intrigue</e>, though is
                more suited to life amongst the criminal classes. With it,
                comes knowledge of how to survive on the street, how to
                gain the trust of those who live on the wrong side of the
                law, as well as how to find them in the first place.

    <skill name="Gambling" type="social">
        <default>Guile</default>

        <description>
            <para>
                Knowledge of how to play games of chance. Used with charisma
                for bluffing, intelligence to figure out the odds of
                something, or perception to spot cheating. Does not really
                help if the game is totally chance based.
            </para>
        </description>
    </skill>

    <skill name="Game" type="social">
        <description>
            <para>
                Knowledge of, and skill at playing a game such as chess
                or Hnefatafl. A skill is required for each game played,
                though similar games may allow half skill. This is based
                on intelligence.
            </para>

            <para>
                The simplist way to find the winner for a game, is for
                both opponents to roll their skill, and the highest roll
                wins. If it is desired to play out the game in more
                detail, then proceed as follows.
            </para>

            <para>
                Each opponent makes a skill check each turn of the game.
                If one exceeds the other by five or more, then they gain
                an advantage. Each advantage gained gives +3 to the skill
                check next turn. On gaining the fourth advantage, the
                player is considered the winner. If the player with the
                advantage looses a turn, then they loose a level of
                advantage.
            </para>

    <skill name="Lip reading" type="social">
        <description>
            <para>
                The skill of reading lips. Each 10 rolled gives an
                equivalent point of language skill. There may be penalties
                for distance, or partial visibility.

    <skill name="Perform" type="social">
        <default>Charm</default>

        <description>
            <para>
                A skill which covers many forms of social skills,
                including oratory, poetry and singing. It may be used to
                rouse a crowd, invent some poetry on the spot, or remember
                a poem or song well enough to recite or sing it.
            </para>

            <para>
                The mood of the audience can be affected with either song,
                poetry or oratory. The performer matches their skill roll
                against the will of the audience. If the audience can be
                treated as a <e>crowd</e>, take the average will and roll
                once for the whole audience (a vocal few will tend to
                lead the silent majority). Success by the performer will
                mean the crowd listens to what the performer says, and
                will think about it, though their opinion isn't shifted
                greatly. For each full 10 the performer beats the will
                of the crowd, the crowd's mood is shifted one category.
            </para>

            <para>
                When singing or reciting poetry, the mood of the audience
                can be shifted, sometimes considerably. This can be done
                subtly, though it takes an evening of performance to carry
                it out.
            </para>

            <para>
                A more direct way to sway an audience is through oratory.
                This is quicker and more direct then by choice of song,
                but is also pretty blatent.
            </para>
        </description>

        <examples>
            <example target="10">
                Sing without inflicting pain on listeners. Less than this
                may get the character forcibly removed from the stage.
            </example>

            <example target="20">
                Sing well enough to impress the audience, though not in a
                way that will be particularly remembered.
            </example>

            <example target="30">
                Sing very well. The singer will be well received, and
                probably kept around for more of the same. The mood of
                the audience can be shifted subtly.
            </example>

            <example target="40">
                The singer will be spoken of for months to come, and people
                will be most eager to please. The mood of the audience can
                be shifted noticeably.
            </example>

            <example target="50">
                All others will be compared (probably unfavourably) to the
                singer, who will be heralded as a master of their art. The
                singer pretty much has control over the mood of the audience.

        <description>

                at any rate.
            </example>

            <example target="30">
                Dance really well, much better than most people can hope
