    <skill name="Area lore" type="knowledge">
        <description>
            <para>
                Knowledge of a given area, including geographical and
                political knowledge. The <e>Area lore</e> skill is used
                when checking to see if a character has heard of a person,
                place or organisation. Area lore is nearly always based on
                intelligence.
            </para>

            <para>
                There is an area lore skill for each area, normally an area
                the size of a country, with the same culture. An area lore
                skill can give knowledge of surrounding areas, though such
                knowledge will be prejudiced by the beliefs of the original
                area the skill is for.

            <para>
                Performing major operations on a wounded person. This
                requires some specialist tools (though rarely more complicated
                than sharp knives and tongs).

                Interpreting dreams.

    <!-- First aid -->
    <skill name="First aid" type="knowledge">
        <description>
            <para>
                Provides care and treatment of wounds to stop bleeding and
                prevent infection. Once a wound has been successfully
                first aided, it may begin healing naturally. First aid
                checks are generally made with intelligence. First aid can
                also be used to treat stuns.
            </para>

            <para>
                To treat a character's wounds, the base difficulty is 10.
                This is modified upwards by the total of the character's
                stun and wound penalties (a fatally wounded character (-15)
                would be difficulty 25 to treat). Success means that the
                wounds will begin healing naturally. If the roll was made
                by 10 or more, then one level of wound is also healed.
            </para>

            <para>
                Stuns are a base difficulty of zero to first aid, again
                modified by total stun and wound penalties. Success heals
                one stun, and each 10 over that heals another level of
                stuns. Stuns do not need to be treated before they begin
                healing.

            <para>
                First aid for animals. The <e>first aid</e> skill may be
                substituted, though it takes twice as long, and no wounds
                and no more than one stun can be healed immediately,
                regardless of the roll.

                person skilled in heraldry can recognise nobles, understand
                and describe the code of heraldic arms, and make guesses
                as to who someone is allied with based on their coat of
                arms. Based on intelligence.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Area lore</e> may be substituted, though all rolls are

        <description>
            <para>
                There are many <e>religion</e> skills, one for each god or
                cult. Knowledge of other gods and religions can be provided
                by a single religion skill (though the amount depends on
                hoe much contact that religion has with the others), but
                such knowledge will be biased by the point of view of the
                source of the skill.
            </para>

            <para>
                The skill gives knowledge of the god, customs and rituals,
