            <para>
                This skill covers all forms of athletics, gymnastics and
                acrobatics, including running, jumping and climbing. It is a
                very broad skill, but it is very rare for a character to be
                interested in one facet of it, and not the others. See the
                <e>Introduction</e> for a full list of what can be done
                with this skill.

            <para>
                This skill is used by the character when there is a chance
                of noticing something which isn't obvious, such as someone
                trying to sneak around, people moving at a distance, or
                looking for a secret door. If the character is asleep,
                then any awareness rolls are quartered. If the character
                is only dozing (or day dreaming), then rolls are halved.
