                you gain an extra level of success that goes towards making
                you look good. This covers dancing, gymnastics or even

                favour, you may always roll twice and take the highest
                roll. This will not help you when trying to convey
                complex information (e.g. teaching) or when not being
                nice (e.g., commanding or intimidating). It may help

                You are more than capable of making yourself heard
