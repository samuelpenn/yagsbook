            <para>
                This provides a broad knowledge of all alien races, from
                the different versions of Humaniti, to Aslan, Hivers,
                Vargr etc. You know basic information about the major
                races. It is <e>very easy</e> to know simple facts
                (a short one sentance description) of a minor race,
                and <e>moderate</e> for an obscure race. More detailed
                information about their physiology and culture is
                harder.

            <para>
                Moving from A to B in a star system is rarely a case of
                pointing in the right direction and accelerating. The
                quickest path is often a curve, and the destination has
                a habit of moving. Being able to calculate routes between
                planets requires a lot of knowledge of orbital mechanics,
                physics and maths.

        <short>Plotting a course through jump space.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Plotting a course through jump space is a difficult
                process, and getting it wrong can result in a very messy
                death. How good you are determines how long it takes. The
                examples given below assume access to a basic computer,
                and you only want to make a one parsec jump. Add +5 to the
                difficulty for each extra parsec jumped.

        <short>Piloting a small space craft.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                The skill of being able to pilot a small space craft, such
                as a shuttle, fighter or cargo pod. Anything much larger
                doesn't require <e>piloting</e> as such, and uses the
                <e>Orbital navigation</e> or <e>Spaceship systems</e>
                skills instead.
            </para>

            <para>
                This skill is most useful for ships up to 100t in size.
                For spaceships larger than this, there is a +5 to the
                difficulty of all skill checks for manouevering, and a
                further +5 for each doubling of size (e.g., up to 200t is
                +5, up to 400t is +10 etc).
            </para>

            <para>
                As for the <e>Pilot</e> skill, can be used to fire front
                mounted guns.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Knowledge of how to fly and operate a spaceship. This is
                the skill needed by all bridge crew, and at least some
                of the engineering crew as well. It covers the most
                common protocols and etiquette involved in flying a
                spaceship in an inhabited system, how to access ship
                systems, how to provide the navigation computers with
                instructions and so on.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                The distances and scales involved in spaceship combat make
                the entire enterprise of conducting a battle completely
                different from more mundane surface events. This skill
                provides knowledge of how to judge distances and speeds,
                the type of weapons deployed in most space battles, and
                how to make best use of offensive and defensive systems.

        <short>Safely using orbital re-entry vehicles.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You have been trained to use personal re-entry sleds which
                allow you to safely land on the ground from orbit. They
                are heavily heat shielded, and can cope with hypersonic
                velocities during reentry. They are used both for military
                assaults and as an (expensive) extreme sport.

        <short>Protecting your mind from psionic attack.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Though Psionics is outlawed in the Imperium, law enforcement
                and military agencies sometimes have to go up against those
                who are trained in its use. The military will sometimes give
                training to its special forces to protect from mental assault
                and mind reading.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Psionic Block</e> does not require any actual psionic
                ability, but by concentrating on repetitive words and
                phrases the trained individual can prevent others from
                reading their mind. Normally this precludes any other
                actions, and all skill checks are at -40 whilst attempting
                this. It is very obvious to anyone looking at you that you
                are concentrating hard on something.

        <short>Predicting groups of people.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                This is the somewhat shaky study of predicting the behaviour
                of large groups of people. It has never been totally proven
                to work, though there is circumstantial evidence for it.

        <short>Piloting a small RPV.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You have experience in piloting small remote controlled
                vehicles, such as spy drones, model aircraft and similar
                devices. This is generally a <t>Dexterity</t> based skill.
                The RPV itself may provide a bonus depending on its
                manouevrability and control device.
