                You are a Vargr, a species descended from old Terran
                wolves and uplifted by the ancients. Vargr are
                ill-disciplined, prone to anger and violence but
                loyal to those they consider friend. They can be
                difficult to get on with.

                your <e>half strength</e>, which represents the strength
                in your arms and legs for punching and kicking purposes.
                You full strength is four points higher, and is used for
