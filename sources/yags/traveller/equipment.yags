            <title>Equipment</title>

            <para>
                There is a wide variety of equipment available throughout
                the Imperium. The full set of equipment lists for TL 12
                is given here.
            </para>

                <para>
                    Costs are listed for the TL of introduction for any
                    item. At one TL beyond that, halve the cost. At two
                    TLs, the cost is one third. Beyond that, cost may
                    actually go up due to the item having been long since
                    replaced by something else. If there aren't better
                    alternatives, then the cost is no better than a third.

                    <title>TL 8 (Information Age)</title>

                    <para>
                        By TL8, computers have become ubiquitous. Personal
                        mobile communication have transformed society to
                        the point where many people cannot imagine not
                        being in instant communication with their friends
                        and colleagues.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Digital information networks span the globe,
                        allowing the sharing and retrieval of pretty much
                        any information desired. Even secure military and
                        government systems start to become attached to
                        these networks, before enhancing their capability
                        and reducing their security.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Gene therapy, cloning, DNA testing and other advances
                        in medical and biological sciences change the face
                        of the world. Genetically modified foods have the
                        capability to feed billions, and genetically modified
                        humans start moral and ethical arguments only previously
                        mentioned in science fiction.

                    <title>TL 9 (Interplanetary)</title>

                    <para>
                        Early space faring civilisation, will have the
                        capability to colonise other worlds within their
                        own solar system. Computers are common with
                        world spanning information networks. Fusion power
                        starts to become feasible, opening the doors to
                        improved starship drives and also helping to feed
                        society's increasing desire for power hungry
                        electronics.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Contra-gravity starts to become possible, though
                        designs at this stage are bulky and expensive.
                        Basically, contra-gravity allows a machine to push
                        against nearby matter, though the strength of the
                        force drops off very rapidly (initially, within a
                        few metres) allowing hover vehicles but not flight
                        to orbit. As the technology improves, so combined
                        aerospacecraft that use contra-gravity to reduce their
                        weight and traditional rockets for thrust make flight
                        to orbit cheap and affordable.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Medical science allows routine cloning, which
                        together with gene therapy begins to wipe out
                        inherited diseases. Super drugs which can cure most
                        known illness and disease become common. Personal
                        communications shrink to implants which combine
                        phone, PDA and entertainment functions. Cybernetics
                        becomes common, both as enhancements and also for
                        medical reasons.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Fashion is not untouched by the rise of technology,
                        and smart clothing becomes pretty standard as every
                        day wear. Simple electronic functionality can be
                        printed onto textiles, allowing simple graphics to
                        be displayed on sleeves. Colour changing ability
                        is common, with advertising and slogons on T-shirts
                        having simple animations. More expensive clothing
                        can adapt itself according to feedback from sensors
                        in contact with your body, reacting to temperature,
                        excitement or intoxication.

                    <title>TL 10</title>

                    <para>
                        The early Third Imperium was considered TL 10.
                        Contra-grav is rare, but stardrives are common,
                        though mostly limited to J1 or J2.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Gauss weapons are the norm.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>TL 11</title>

                    <para>
                        This covers the Third Imperium from about 500 to
                        about 1000. There are many TL 11 worlds within the
                        Imperium. They are slightly backwards compared to
                        the highest levels of Imperium technology, but it
                        is mostly a level of degree.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Contra-grav is common, but wheeled and railed travel
                        is still the norm. Computer networks span the world,
                        and good medical technology is commonly available.
                        Full regrowth is not possible, and some things still
                        require cybernetic replacements.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Most common weapons are gauss weapons, with plasma
                        and laser weapons filling speciality roles.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>TL 12</title>

                    <para>
                        This is the technological level of the Imperium's
                        military, and the highest level found commonly
                        amongst its worlds. The Imperium is considered to
                        have reached TL12 around the year 1000.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Contra-grav is ubiquitous, turing personalities
                        are found in many places, common stardrives can
                        manage between J-3 and J-6.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Guass weapons are beginning to give way to plasma
                        and laser weapons, as the latter become more
                        reliable, smaller and cheaper. Fusion weapons
                        begin to become man-portable.

                <title>Legality</title>

                <para>
                    The legality of an item determines who is allowed to
                    use it. Some worlds are more restrictive than others,
                    and items which are allowed to be freely carried and
                    used in one place, may be forbiddon in another.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Generally, an item is freely available to civilians
                    if its legality rating is equals or exceeds the law
                    level of the world. If it is one less, then it may
                    be available with a license, otherwise use and ownership
                    is restricted to government or specialist personel
                    only.

                            in fog and thick atmospheres. Does not loose accuracy

                            Plasma or fusion weapon. If it does damage against
                            living targets then it does damage twice - once at
                            full effectiveness, and a second time at one lower

                    The following weapons are available in the Imperium. Slug throwers
                    still make for good, general purpose, weapons and are the least
                    likely to break when put through the sort of abuse most equipment
                    sees in the battlefield.

                        by troops in full battledress. At the very least they
                        require backpacks for energy or ammunition.

                        of ancient weapons.
