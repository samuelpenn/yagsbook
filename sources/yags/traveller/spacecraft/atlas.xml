        <ss:brief>
            An ugly, simple but extremely practical design of small freighter
            which became popular before the rise of the Third Imperium.
        </ss:brief>

        <ss:physical>
            A boxy design with exterior engine mounts at the rear. Defended
            by a single top mounted twin turret. It is pretty much useless
            in an atmosphere, and is not rated for planetary landings.

        <ss:background>
            Built at Kamurinmur Dockyards, it was a design that quickly
            became popular due to its cheapness, practicality and ease of
            manufacture. It has good in-system capability, which reflects
            a time when trade between systems was less important than
            trade within a system. Less sophisticated jump software also
            meant longer journeys in-system after a jump.
