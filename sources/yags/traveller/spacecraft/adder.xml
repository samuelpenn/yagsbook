        <ss:physical>
            A very basic design which was simple and cheap to manufacture,
            making it ubiquitous for its time. Limited wings provide lift
            during take off and re-entry.

            Designed in the third century of the Third Imperium by Outworld
            Workshops at Orkney in Ilelish, the Adder was one of their
            first commercially successful designs. Built with redundant
            systems, a rugged hull which is highly forgiving of rushed repair
            jobs and good atmospheric capability it is highly suited for
            working for long periods away from good quality space ports.
            These days, it is often used by smugglers and traders working
            the edges of civilised space.
