            <para>
                This article looks at how <t>Perception</t> works in
                considerable more detail than in the basic rules. Most of
                the rules here are not meant to be used all the time - for
                the most part they can be used simply as a guide.

                <title>Basic Sight</title>

                <para>
                    Seeing people is generally straightforward. How hard is
                    it to spot a person who is 100m away though? Or 1km?
                    How about 1km and hiding behind a bush?
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is assumed that a person has a basic spotting range
                    equal to their <t>Perception</t> x 100m. A typical
                    person can make out another person out to 300m. Beyond
                    this range, double the difficulty to spot a person.
                </para>

                        a further +10.

                    To spot a target, you make a simple
                    <y:perception>Awareness</y:perception> check at the
                    specified difficulty. If you are actively looking
                    (i.e., not doing anything else other than simple
                    movement) then the difficulty is halved. It is assumed
                    that generally people aren't able to <e>actively look</e>
                    for long periods of time.

                    a person can be assumed to make a spot check of 26,
                    enabling them to see a stationary person across a field
                    out to 300m.

                    <para>
                        If you wish to actively hide from the sight of
                        others, then you roll your
                        <y:perception>Stealth</y:perception> and this
                        becomes the base difficulty to spot you, modified
                        by the previous tables.

                        <para>
                            If you have something to hide behind which provides
                            full cover (such as a wall), and aren't interested
                            in being able to see those looking for you, then
                            hiding can be considered an automatic success.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            If you wish to take the occassional peek, then you
                            only get the 90% cover bonus. Note that objects
                            which provide almost total cover (such as a tree)
                            only give the 90% cover bonus, since it doesn't
                            provide cover from all angles.

                            On the other hand, if there is no cover at all,
                            then hiding can be difficult. If you're on a
                            relatively flat plain, with only poor cover,
                            then halve the <e>stealth</e> roll. With minimal
                            cover, quarter the <e>stealth</e> roll.

                            If you are wearing suitable camouflage, then

                            the viewer. Standard camouflage is anything that
                            is a suitable colour to match the background.

                <title>Alarms and Sensors</title>

                <para>
                    Sensor systems have, much like characters do, two
                    properties - a <t>Perception</t> attribute which
                    represents the physical sensitivity of the device,
                    and an <e>Awareness</e> skill which represents the
                    quality of the processing software. The technological
                    level is more likely to affect the type of sensors
                    available, their price and availability, and how
                    easy they are to fool.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <e>Sensors</e> are generally limited to sensing
                    only a specific type of activity - motion, sound,
                    heat, vibration etc. If you know how to counter them,
                    then they can be quite easy to counter.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A typical sensor suite will have a <t>Perception</t>
                    of about 3. A more complete setup (several well
                    placed sensors) will have a <t>Perception</t> of 5,
                    and an extensive setup will have 7.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A typical <e>Awareness</e> score for an off the shelf
                    sensor system would be 4. A good quality system will
                    have an <e>Awareness</e> of 8, and top end systems 12.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For most sensors, it is difficulty 10 to detect what
                    they are looking for, or the <y:agility>Stealth</y:agility>
                    of someone who is correctly trying to avoid detection.

                    <para>
                        The type of sensors often used in burglar alarms
                        from TL7 onwards. They are relatively easy to
                        fool, simply by moving slowly. Can be countered
                        with basic Stealth.

                    <para>
                        Each sensor has a +1 to detection difficulty for
                        each metre of range at TL7, +1 per 2m at TL8 and
                        +1 per 5m at TL9+.

                        These simply listen out for noise, and are
                        generally set to trip at the sound of someone
                        walking around. Anyone using <e>Stealth</e> to
                        keep quiet will counter these sensors, even if
                        they don't know that they are there.

                        Available from TL8, these use microwave sensors to
                        detect motions such as heartbeats and breathing,
                        and are capable of detecting people trapped under
                        rock - they are very sensitive.

                        The only way to avoid detection is to wear clothing
                        which blocks microwaves. Typical protection adds +10
                        to the difficulty, good quality adds +25 and excellent
                        quality +50.

                        Similar to <e>Life Sensors</e>, but look for the heat
                        signature of a living person. Can be countered by
                        special clothing in a similar way, though the bonus is
                        doubled since they're easier to hide from.

                        Designed to detect vibrations in the ground, as caused
                        by someone walking around. As for sound sensors, they
                        can be countered by stealth, though only if the
                        intruder knows they are there (more is involved than
                        simply being quiet).

                    <para>
                        Available at TL7+. At TL8+ footwear to try and reduce
                        vibrations are available, providing +5, +10 and +15
                        bonuses to stealth for standard, good and excellent
                        quality equipment. Only applies when actively trying
                        to counter such sensors.

                        They can be highly sensitive, but quite restricted in
                        what they can detect. At TL9 and above, they can
                        perform DNA sequencing of people present in a room.

                <para>
                    Sensor systems such as radar are designed to work
                    across tens or hundreds of kilometres. It is assumed
                    that the size of the sensor system is of great
                    importance at this scale. As for ranged weapons, these
                    types of sensors have a <e>distance increment</e>,
                    which is based on the size of the sensor system. For
                    most systems, it is proportional to the square root
                    of the sensor volume/mass.

                <para>
                    As for smaller sensor systems, the <e>skill</e> of the
                    system represents software capability, and the
                    <e>attribute</e> represents the quality of the
                    hardware. A typical civilian system will have a
                    <t>Perception</t> of 3, military or scientific systems
                    will be closer to 5.
