            <para>
                Representing the environment in game terms can be
                complicated, and often it is not necessary to do so.
                There are a few situations however where having a
                consistent in-game representation of the world can
                be useful, especially when magic is involved.
            </para>

            <para>
                What follows is a number of rating systems for
                describing the natural environment - the weather,
                fires and disasters for instance
            </para>

                <para>
                    Not really the weather, but describes what sort of
                    clothing gives good protection against the weather.
					How well protected you are from the environment is
					defined as a level from 0 (totally naked) to 5 or
					more (modern arctic clothing).

                        Person is wearing no or very little clothing which
                        does nothing to keep them warm. Examples would be
                        a bikini, or even a thin t-shirt and shorts for
                        purposes of cold (but will count as light for
                        protection from the sun).

                    <item target="1" value="Light clothes.">
                        Normal everyday summer clothes - thin trousers and

                <para>
                    Heat and cold assume that the character is totally
                    without protection - i.e. naked. Layers of clothing
                    will increase the effective temperature (each level
                    of clothing increases the temperature by one level).
                </para>

                <para>
                    A breeze will tend to lower the effective temperature
                    since it takes heat away from the body. Every two
                    levels of wind reduces the temperature by one level.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Note that these temperatures assume a temperature which
                    is comfortable for humans to be the average.
                </para>

                <targetlist>
                    <item target="-5" value="Extreme cold.">
                        Arctic winter conditions, temperature around -50C.
                        Every minute a character gains a fatigue level.
                        When they become unconscious, this becomes wounds.
                    </item>

                    <item target="-4" value="Severe cold.">
                        Dangerously cold, around -30C. Gain a point of
                        fatigue every 10 minutes.
                    </item>

                    <item target="-2" value="Cold.">
                        Around 0C. Character gains one fatigue every
                        minute. Once unconscious, then they gain wounds
                        at the same rate.
                    </item>

                    <item target="-1" value="Chilly.">
                        Around 10C. One fatigue an hour.

                    <item target="+0" value="Comfortable.">
                        Around 20C. Moderate clothes.
                    </item>

                    <item target="+1" value="Warm.">
                        A warm 30C. Very pleasantly warm, though can be
                        too warm if you are also exerting yourself.
                    </item>

                    <item target="+2" value="Hot.">
                        An unpleasantly hot 40C. Nice if you are sunbathing,
                        but too hot to get much work done. One level of
                        exhaustion each hour unless plenty of water is
                        being drunk.
                    </item>

                    <item target="+3" value="Very hot.">
                        About 50C, which is unbearably hot. Even with lots
                        of water, you will gain a level of exhaustion each
                        hour. Without sufficient water, double the rate.
                    </item>

                    <item target="+4" value="Severe heat.">
                        About 70C, which is hotter than temperatures get
                        naturally anywhere on Earth (except for actual fires).
                        Gain exhaustion every minute. Drinking doesn't help.
                    </item>

                    <item target="+5" value="Extreme heat.">
                        About 100C. Gain a level of stun every round.
