            <title>Spacecraft</title>

            <para>
                Though spacecraft are just another type of vehicle, they
                are provided their own section here for a number of reasons.
                Firstly, all the interesting spacecraft tend to be
                imaginary works of fiction, and the physics by which most
                of them operate are incompatible with each other. Firstly
                then, we need to lay down the laws by which spacecraft in
                <tm>Yags</tm> work.
            </para>

            <para>
                Secondly, the <tm>Yags</tm> rules for vehicles assume that
                designs are based on real life, or near real-life, designs.
                There is no real design system as such - just a set of
                guidelines to try and keep things vaguely consistent.
                Spacecraft will often be designed entirely from scratch
                without any basis in reality, so it helps to tie things
                down a bit.
            </para>

            <para>
                Thirdly, whilst most people have a good idea about how a
                car behaves, few people can get their head around space
                travel. Even if you don't drive, you've almost definitely
                been in a car that's travelled through a town centre, so
                you know how fast it goes and how long a journey takes.
                Most people don't have that common sense knowledge for
                a journey from Earth to Mars, or a trip around the
                moons of Saturn. A set of rules helps fill in for that
                lack of common sense.
            </para>

            <para>
                As with all rules in games, they can be ignored. However,
                the rules here do allow ships to be designed with a
                reasonable degree of accuracy. However, this does also
                mean that a little bit of maths may be involved.
            </para>

                <quote signature="Douglas Adams">
                    Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how
                    vastly mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think
                    it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's
                    just peanuts to space.

                <para>
                    The physics of <tm>Yags SciFi</tm> is somewhat harder
                    than most Hollywood fiction. It can take days to weeks
                    to travel across the solar system, and weapon ranges
                    are in the order of tens of kilometres. Anti-gravity
                    exists, though only at higher tech levels and it can
                    be quite limited. Ships move by throwing hot stuff
                    out the back very fast according to the principles of
                    Newtonian motion.

                    <title>Sizes</title>

                    <para>
                        The size of ships is measured in displacement tonnes
                        of liquid hydrogen. 1 dt is about 15 cubic metres
                        (about 14.75 to be more precise, but 15 is assumed).
                        Ships below 10dt are rare - generally light fighters
                        and similar vessels. A typical ship that might be
                        owned by a group of PC's will be on the order of
                        100dt - 500dt in size.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Even the smallest fighters tend to be around
                        Size 15 in <tm>Yags</tm> terms - larger than any
                        modern day tank. The largest vessels will be
                        hundreds of thousands of displacement tonnes,
                        with a million tonnes being extremely rare.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Note that an Imperial class Star Destroyer from
                        <em>Star Wars</em> would be over 4 million tonnes,
                        so ships are relatively small compared to those in
                        many Hollywood films.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Time and Movement</title>

                    <para>
                        Time is measured in turns of 10 seconds. This is
                        twice as long as a standard <s>Yags</s> round, but
                        is a simpler number to deal with when working out
                        distances and acceleration.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        All distances are measured in kilometres. Effective
                        ranges of most space combats will vary from tens of
                        kilometres to hundreds of kilometres, depending on
                        the size of vessels involved. This ranges are
                        relatively small for space, and it means that objects
                        such as planets are huge relative to a combat arena.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        How quickly a spacecraft moves is measured by its
                        <e>acceleration</e>, which is given in 'g'. Every
                        'g' of acceleration allows the ship to accelerate
                        up to (roughly) 1km/turn/turn. A craft with an
                        acceleration of 3g, will be moving at 3km/turn
                        after the first turn, 6km/turn after the second
                        turn and so on.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        <e>Delta V (dV)</e> represents the maximum speed of a
                        space craft. Any ship using reaction drives (i.e.,
                        the type that burn 'fuel' and throw it out the
                        back) will have a maximum speed. <e>dV</e> means
                        change in velocity, so any acceleration (even if it
                        is to slow down, or change direction) comes out of
                        your total dV.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

            <sect2>
                <title>Design the Hull</title>

                <para>
                    The first decision point is the size of the ship. This
                    is measured in displacement tonnes, and for most jump
                    capable craft will be in the order of 100dt - 1000dt.
                    Ships bigger than this tend to be military vessels,
                    large freighters or cruise ships. The tonnage controls
                    how much room there is for weapons, drives, crew etc,
                    and also how much damage the ship can take.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The second decision is the rough shape of the vessel.
                    This affects the internal volume (space for things),
                    surface area (weight of armour and space for turrets)
                    and modifiers to Health and Agility.

                    The volume multiplier gives the internal volume of the craft.
                    A 200dt <e>Dispersed</e> hull for example will only have 100dt
                    available for systems.

                    Area gives the surface area multiplier. The surface area is
                    equal to the square of the cube root of mass. Turrets, drives
                    and other surface features have to fit into the available
                    area. Surface area also governs armour - the bigger the surface
                    area, the greater the mass of armour required to give a
                    certain soak bonus.

                            Most rockets consist of 90% fuel by mass. As the

                            acceleration increases. Doing this correctly involves

                            If you want, assume that an empty fuel tank has a

                            Chemical rockets often remain in use up until TL 12 when
                            the <e>plasma torch</e> becomes available. Despite being
                            inefficient, they are the cleanest form of drive, and don't
                            leave behind radioactive residue, making them suited for
                            getting off planets where you care about the environment.
                            For interplanetary travel, they stop being used around TL 9
                            or 10, as more efficient (but dirtier) drives take over.

                        <para>
                            Nuclear fission rockets work on a similar principle to
                            chemical rockets - a propellent is heated and thrown out
                            the back. However, instead of the propellent being used
                            as the fuel, the fuel is Uranium in a nuclear reactor,
                            which is used to heat a propellent such as water or
                            hydrogen.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            They are bigger and heavier than chemical rockets, so
                            a larger engine is needed for the same thrust. However,
                            they are a lot more efficient, so require far less fuel
                            for the same delta-v.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            However, they are incredibly dirty, and require a lot
                            of radiation shielding. If water is being used as a
                            propellent instead of hydrogen, add +5 to the basic
                            thrust, but reduce efficiency by 500.
