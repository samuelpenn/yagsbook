            <para>
                The term drugs is used in Yags to describe any chemical
                substance which is designed to have an affect on a person -
                either detrimental or otherwise. It includes poisons,
                recreational drugs, medicines etc.
            </para>

                <title>Types of Drugs</title>

                <para>
                    Drugs, poisons and medicines are grouped into the
                    following categories. <e>Generics</e> are the
                    base type of drug - all others are specialist versions
                    of this.
                </para>

                    <para>
                        <e>Generic drugs</e> can have a wide range of
                        effects, and cover all the drugs not covered by
                        the more specific types. A <e>generic</e> will
                        often have several effects which may or may not
                        be resisted by the subject. Poisons are generally
                        generics.

                                The strength of a drug determines how much of it
                                is required to have the listed effect. This is
                                given on a scale from 1 (not very potent) to 6
                                (incredibly potent).

                                levels, and how much of a substance is required in
