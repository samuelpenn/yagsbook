                Tonight: an awful new car from Rover; a brilliant new car from

            <para>
                <tm>Yags</tm> is all about characters and the things that
                they can do. But sometimes a character wants to do something
                bigger, faster and more awesome than they can manage with
                their frail fleshy bodies. For this reason <tm>Yags</tm>
                also includes these rules for vehicles.
            </para>

            <para>
                The term <e>vehicle</e> can also be extended to cover all
                forms of constructs, from scary killer robots to fortresses
                and giant space ships. More mundanely, it also covers
                trains, planes and cars. There are sections to cover combat
                between vehicles, since the sort of very big guns that
                military vehicles have a tendency to carry step outside the
                bounds of character scale combat.
            </para>

            <para>
                In brief, vehicles mostly the same rules as characters.
                There are some changes to account for the differences in
                size, but a most things are additional, the character
                rules merely being one end of a sliding scale.

                <para>
                    Whether something counts as a vehicle is based on its
                    construction rather than its size. Generally, something
                    that has been built out of non-living material is
                    classed as a vehicle. It is not based on size - a
                    motorbike is vehicle scale whilst an elephant is still
                    character scale.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Vehicles also include buildings, so a house uses vehicle
                    rules as far as absorbing damage is concerned.
                </para>

                <para>
                    All vehicles have a <t>Size</t> statistic, just like
                    characters do. This is on the same scale, so a <t>Size</t> 5
                    motorbike is about the same size as an adult human.
                    A vehicle's <t>Size</t> is roughly proportional to its
                    volume. A <t>Size</t> 5 vehicle is about 1 cubic metre.
                    Every ten fold increase in volume adds +5 to the <t>Size</t>.
                    Some examples of vehicle sizes are below.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Because of the logarithmic scale, even very large SF
                    starships can be represented in double digit sizes.
                    Since attacks can't damage targets more than 15 size
                    points larger, damage and armour values can also
                    remain relatively low.

                    <title>Vehicle Damage</title>

                    <para>
                        Damage, and the absorbtion thereof, is considered to be
                        on a different scale to characters. Unless noted, weapons
                        and armour are <e>character scale</e>. Anything to do with
                        a vehicle tends to be <e>vehicle scale</e>, and will be
                        specified with a 'Vc' in its properties. A vehicle scale
                        weapon that does +20 damage is far more effective than
                        a character scale weapon which does the same.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Vehicles don't have wounds and stuns, but they do have
                        <e>damage</e>. This is based on the vehicle's <t>Size</t>,
                        though isn't directly proportional to it. Instead, it is
                        equal to the square of the vehicle's <t>Size</t>, divided
                        by 20:
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Damage levels = <t>Size</t>^2 / 20 (round to nearest).
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        There are 3 damage levels - superficial, moderate and
                        critical. A vehicle that has taken superficial damage
                        is at no penalty to manouevering, a moderately damaged
                        vehicle is at -10 and a critically damaged vehicle is
                        at -25. In addition, a vehicle always has one additional
                        damage level in <e>superficial</e>, and one in a fourth
                        level called <e>disabled</e>, which gives a -40 penalty.
                    </para>

                    <example title="Damage Levels">
                        <para>
                            As an example, take a modern BMW M3, with a
                            Size of 9. It will have 4 body levels
                            (9 * 9 = 81, divided by 20 = 4), plus the two
                            free levels for a total of 6.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            The first five get split between superficial (2),
                            moderate (2) and critical (1), and the sixth
                            goes into disabled (1).
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            The first two points of damage the car takes will
                            leave it as <e>superficially damaged</e>. On taking
                            its third level it becomes <e>moderately damaged</e>.
                            This is similar to how character scale damage works.
                        </para>
                    </example>

                    <para>
                        There are two types of vehicle damage - <e>major</e>
                        and <e>minor</e>. The former is the default type and
                        is similar to <e>wounds</e> at character scale.
                        <e>Minor</e> damage is like <e>stuns</e> and is non
                        cumulative, but is applied to the same damage track
                        as <e>major</e> damage. Generally, damage from
                        character scale weapons is <e>minor</e> damage.

                        <title>Shooting at Vehicles</title>

                        <para>
                            If a vehicle is attacked with a character scale
                            weapon, then the damage roll is halved and the
                            damage caused is <e>Minor</e>. Any vehicle which
                            is 10 or more <t>Size</t> points larger than the
                            weapon (normally vehicles of <t>Size</t> 15+)
                            take no damage from character scale attacks.
                            Also, only <e>wounds</e> are converted to
                            vehicle damage - stuns are ignored.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Man portable firearms are generally considered to
                            be <t>Size</t> 5, though specialist anti-vehicle
                            weapons may be larger. The most effective of these
                            are generally classed as vehicle scale anyway.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            If a character weapon happens to be 5+ size
                            points larger than the vehicle under attack, then
                            the damage caused is <e>major</e> damage. If the
                            weapon is 10+ size points larger, then then damage
                            roll is not halved. Outside of fantasy, such
                            events will tend to be limited to elephants trampling
                            a motorcycle.

                        <title>Shooting at Characters</title>

                        <para>
                            If a vehicle scale weapon is used against characters
                            then the character receives no soak roll unless they
                            are fully protected with heavy armour. In the latter
                            case then their soak roll is merely halved.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Note that a character scale weapon mounted on a
                            vehicle (e.g. a turret mounted light machine gun)
                            is still considered character scale.

                        <para>
                            If the weapon is 10+ <t>Size</t> points larger than
                            the target, then even heavy armour is completely
                            ignored. Characters also suffer the multiplication
                            of damage from oversized vehicle attacks (see below),
                            but normally it's irrelevant by this point.

                        <para>
                            Differences in size between vehicles can be far
                            greater than that between animals (at least, in the
                            real world). In the modern world, the largest vehicles
                            are aircraft carriers of size 40+. SF starships (not
                            covered under <e>High Tech</e>) can be even larger.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Each vehicle mounted weapon has its own <t>Size</t>
                            which is independant of the vehicle it is mounted on.
                            Most anti-vehicle weapons (such as the main gun on
                            a tank) are <t>Size</t> 10. Secondary weapons (such
                            as a heavy machine gun) will be <t>Size</t> 5.
                            Heavier artillery or naval guns may be <t>Size</t>
                            15, 20 or larger.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            For vehicle on vehicle action, if the target vehicle is
                            10+ <t>Size</t> larger than the attacking weapon then
                            any damage caused is <e>Minor</e>. If the target is
                            15+ <t>Size</t> larger, then no damage is caused.

                            If the attack is 10+ larger, then any damage levels
                            caused are doubled and any armour is halved. Each
                            further +10 <t>Size</t> increase adds a further
                            multiple to the damage caused.

                    Size isn't the only statistic vehicles have in <tm>Yags</tm>.
                    As for characters, <t>Strength</t>, <t>Health</t>,
                    <t>Agility</t> and <t>Perception</t> also exist for vehicles.

                <para>
                    <t>Strength</t> is pretty straightforward, and is a measure
                    of the vehicle's pulling power. It can be compared directly
                    against the strength of a person.

                <para>
                    <t>Health</t> is a measure of the general reliability and
                    toughness of the vehicle. A <t>Health</t> of 3 is pretty
                    standard. A fragile F1 car or broken old banger may have
                    a <t>Health</t> of 2, more rugged off-road cars or military
                    vehicles will have higher <t>Health</t>.

                <para>
                    <t>Agility</t> represents how agile the vehicle is.
                    Generally though. it isn't used directly since vehicles

                    <para>
                        A construct will normally have a base soak equal to
                        its size. If it is stronger or weaker than usual
                        then this can vary. The following guide can be used
                        to determine the base soak of a vehicle or building.
                        These are guidelines only, and any values inbetween
                        (or outside) those given can be used.

                    <para>
                        Vehicles will generally have a <e>speed</e>, which is
                        the top speed in km/h. They also have an <e>acceleration</e>,
                        which is in km/h/s. What this means is that a motorbike
                        with an acceleration of 20 km/h/s will, from a standing
                        start, be doing 20 km/h after 1 second. After 5 seconds
                        (a round) it will be doing 100km/h. In reality acceleration
                        slows as a vehicle approaches its top speed, but this is
                        ignored for simplicity.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If you really want to, halve acceleration if the vehicle
                        is travelling at greater than half its top speed.

                    <para>
                        Each vehicle also has a <e>range</e>, which is how many

                        this is just an average for simplicity. If you want,
                        increase fuel consumption by 50% above 100km/h, double it
                        above 150km/h, and add further multiples for each extra

                        For purposes of combat, a vehicle has a <e>Move</e>

                        can move in a round, in metres. This is equal to
                        half the vehicle's top speed, ignoring unit conversions.
                        For example, a vehicle with a top speed of 180km/h will
                        have a <e>Move</e> of 90. This gives a speed the
                        vehicle can move at in combat without penalty.

                    Vehicle mounted weapons can range from heavy machine guns

                    a mockery of the automatic fire rules, and the ranges and
                    damage levels mean human targets don't stand much of a

                    <para>
                        The standard rules for automatic fire assume a burst
                        size of 10 bullets, with the option of larger burst
                        sizes for really high rates of fire. Many modern
                        autocannons routinely spew out thousands of rounds
                        a minute, making the more extreme ends of the rules
                        somewhat common.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Firstly, the effects of a burst according to the number
                        of bullets in it is unaffected, maxing out at 37+.
                        An autocannon burst size of 100 bullets is no different
                        in this sense than one with 50 bullets, except it is
                        retains effectiveness at longer ranges.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        An automatic weapon halves the burst size at 10% of
                        short range, and each subsequent multiple of this.
                        A more general rule is that the base range is
                        increased to be 1% of short range per bullet in the
                        burst. An autocannon with a basic burst size of 50,
                        is fully effective out to 50% of short range. After
                        this, and for each multiple of 50% of short range,
                        the effective burst size is halved.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If an automatic weapon has a burst size greater than
                        100, then close range is capped at 100%.

                            size is reduced to 25 bullets. Up to 1.5km, it is

                For the most part, vehicles are secondary to the plot - they
                allow characters to get from A to B with a minimum of time
                and fuss. Occasionally however, the journey is the interesting
                bit, and modelling a high speed car chase can be tricky to

                <title>From A to B</title>

                <para>
                    Firstly, when driving a normal route, without any attempt
                    at high speed or evasion, there is a simple
                    <t>Perception</t> based <e>Drive</e> check made every hour
                    at a target of 10. This is not capped by the vehicle's
                    statistics, and mostly comes down to the driver being aware
                    of what is going on around them. After a number of checks
                    equal to their <t>Will</t>, they gain a level of exhaustion,
                    and a further level every 2 checks after that.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If a check is failed, then the driver can opt to either gain
                    an immediate level of exhaustion, or to make a <t>Dexterity</t>
                    based check at the same difficulty. If this succeeds, then an
                    accident is narrowly avoided. Otherwise, there is a collision.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the driver wishes to travel faster than normal, then they
                    can reduce journey time by 20%, but the target difficulties
                    are increased by +5. Each further 5% reduction increases the

                        Everyone is moving, but you need to be aggressive
                        to overtake, since there is rarely a clear line
                        between vehicles. Rush hour on motorways during

                    The easiest option is to abstract everything into a
                    simple die roll. There are three things which need to
                    be taken into consideration:

                        The capability of the driver or pilot, which basically
