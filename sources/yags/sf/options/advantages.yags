            <para>
                You are extremely good looking, and can use it to your
                advantage in your dealings with anyone who finds you
                sexually attractive, or in a situation where being smart
                and presentable would be an advantage. Gain a +1 bonus to
                whatever attribute you are using (normally <t>Empathy</t>).

            <para>
                As well as being <e>good looking</e>, the way in which you
                walk, talk and dress comes across as very sexy to anyone
                who would be sexually attracted to you. Others will tend
                to flirt with you given a chance, and you may gain +2

            <para>
                You own a small jump-capable starship. Choose one of the
                common jump capable starships up to 200t. You probably
                couldn't have afforded to buy the ship, so you may have
                won it in a game, rescued it from a wrecker's yard, or
                simply obtained it through shady means.

            <para>
                Though it may not look like much, it has it where it
                counts, being (mostly) reliable, and tuned to being
                just that bit better than would normally be expected.
                It may need to be able to defend itself (though not too
                well to draw attention), and there's <e>always</e> a
                need to have somewhere to stuff things you don't want
                Imperial customs inspectors to find.

                You are lucky, and receive a +1 to luck checks. You may also

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You have friends in useful places. They may be Imperial
                bureacrats, members of the Navy, or even group of
                terrorists, pirates or underworld bosses who you used
                to have dealings with. They are willing to help you if
                you have the need, though their friendship can only be
                pushed so far, and often they'll want a favour in return.

            <para>
                The sort of help they will be willing and able to provide
                is up to you and the GM. The greater the power and influence
                the friend has, the more they will be constrained in what
                they can do, especially if helping you could harm their
                reputation.

            <para>
                You have information on someone they really don't want
                to be made public. Who they are is up to you, but generally
                the more important they are the less damaging the
                information is. You can get some money out of them, or
                sometimes the odd favour, but they will always be looking
                to get rid their problem permanently, especially if you
                push them too hard.

                Somebody has information that if made public would ruin your
                career, your family and possible end your life. To make
                matters worse, they have no qualms about using the threat
                of release to request small favours from time to time. Of
                course, these favours are always illegal and unsavoury, and
                if anyone finding out about these actions, it would also be

                You have a cybernetic replacement for some bodypart such
                as an arm or eye. It provides no real benefit, and is
                simply a medical replacement for the original which was

                Illiteracy is rare in civilised culture, especially on

                You are unable to read or write (in any language), which
                can also make use of a computer difficult. Learning the
