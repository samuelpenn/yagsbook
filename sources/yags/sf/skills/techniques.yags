                You have experience with fixing and designing

            <para>
                You are experienced with fixing, maintaining and designing
                spacecraft - from orbital shuttles to jump capable star
                cruisers. When used with the appropriate skills, this
                technique enables you to improvise fixes for spaceships,
                and make improvements.

            <para>
                You have a detailed knowledge of quantum gravity, how
                it describes the universe, and a good theoretical
                understanding of how grav technology really works.

            <para>
                You are well read on a variety of alien biologies, and do
                not suffer penalties for having to deal with unusual
                xenomorphs. A truly exceptional biology might be difficult
                to understand at first, but you'll be far better equipped
                to deal with it than someone without your expansive
                knowledge.

                to think about it, but the penalty to other skills is only
                -10 whilst doing it, and somebody in conversation with you
                may notice that you seem somewhat distracted.

                You are able to keep up a permanent psionic block, even
                whilst asleep. You suffer no penalty from using it whilst
                performing other actions, and it will not be noticed by
                other people.
