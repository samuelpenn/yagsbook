            The creature is able to communicate with people within
            a given range via telepathy. It cannot read anything other
            than their surface thoughts. Communication requires a shared
            language to be used.

            An undead creature is a walking corpse, animated through
            supernatural means. Undead do not need to eat, drink or
            breath. They are difficult to kill, since they do no have
            vital organs. An undead has twice the normal number of wound
            and stun levels. They often have abnormal stamina (nine),
            above average strength, and low will.

            An incorporeal creature has no physical body, and hence no
            direct way to affect the physical world. They have no wound
            or stun levels, and no soak, since they cannot be harmed
            physically. An incorporeal may attack by draining the energy
            from people, causing fatigue levels. When attacking, it only
            requires to touch the individual - a parry is useless. Damage
            uses its will x 4 instead of strength, and the target uses
            their will x 4 for soaking.

            <para>
                A blessed creature has been touched by the supernatural,
                and draws strength from some other realm. As such, it is
                able to heal damage dealt to it very quickly, making it
                almost immune to damage from normal sources. A blessed
                creature is either blessed by the light, or blessed by
                darkness. Both types of blessings behave the same, but
                creatures of the light are affected by weapons of
                darkness and vice versa.

            <para>
                A blessed creature, on receiving either wounds or stuns,
                will immediately heal one level of both. This occurs
                after effects of the wound are accounted for. So a single
                blow which fatally wounds a creature could still kill
                it. If the creature survives however, it would then
                become critically wounded (regardless of how wound levels
                beyond fatal the creature was taken).

            <para>
                At the end of the round, and each round thereafter, the
                creature will heal one wound and stun level, until it
                is fully healed.

            <para>
                Some weapons may be blessed (either by light or darkness),
                and damage caused by these cannot be healed with this
                advantage. A light blessed creature cannot heal wounds
                from a darkness weapon, and vice versa.
