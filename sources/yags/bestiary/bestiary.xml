                <title>Sentient or Sapient?</title>

                <para>
                    This article will often differentiate between sapient
                    and sentient creatures. Since the meaning of these terms
                    is not always correctly understood, they are described
                    here, to avoid any confusion.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A sentient creature is one that can perceive their
                    environment, and act upon those perceptions. A human is
                    sentient, but so is a dog, a fly or even an earthworm.
                    Sentient covers pretty much all animals, and possibly
                    some plants. Generally, it doesn't include constructs.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Sapience is far rarer, and describes high level
                    reasoning ability. In the real world, the only animals
                    known definitely to be sapient are humans. Whether
                    animals such as dolphins and chimpanzees are is open to
                    debate.

                <title>Size</title>

                <para>
                    The size rating of a creature gives a rough indication
                    of how big it is. An average adult human is considered
                    to be size five - and very few adult humans will
                    differ from this norm.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The smallest possible size is zero - about the size
                    of a robin or similar bird - something that fits
                    easily into one hand. Creatures any smaller are also
                    size zero, but are very rarely worth bothering about.
                    There is no upper limit on size, and scaling is non
                    linear.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In game terms, a creature's size directly affects how
                    many body levels it has, and also affects some combat
                    statistics.

                        a creature with a strength of zero could conceivably
                        beat an adult human in contest of strength, simply

                <para>
                    A beast's demeanour is a rough guide to its behaviour.
                    Mostly, the descriptions given below deal with how a
                    creature will act if it is threatened, hungry or just
                    surprised. Intelligent beasts have far more complex
                    behaviour patterns than animals, so really this applies
                    to animals only. Intelligent creatures will nearly
                    always have a demeanor of <e>Selfish</e>.

                        A predator is a carnivorous hunter, who will stalk
                        and kill prey for food. Creatures it does not
                        consider prey it will generally ignore, unless it
                        feels threatened. If the prey it attacks puts up
                        a good fight, then it will generally retreat before
                        it can be seriously injured, unless it is already
                        very hungry.

                        avoid healthy food, and patiently wait for injured
                        food to weaken rather than risk injury by attacking

                        is for the herd to run, though animals with suitable
                        defensive abilities may turn and fight if running is

                        Violent beasts are very rare, and are generally

                        will attack for no reason other than because it
                        enjoys killing. It will often fight until heavily

                        danger, but danger is often not noticed until
                        something is actually attacking them. It is possible
                        to walk up to such beasts, without scaring them.

                        Unintelligent beasts are generally constructs. They
                        have no free will, and no sense of self
                        preservation. Depending on their programming, they
                        may defend themselves if attacked, and will always
                        fight to the death unless specifically programmed
                        not to. Some plants may be unintelligent - they
                        may have the ability to grab and hold prey, but will

                        Sapient creatures are often selfish. They will act
                        in their own best interest (though what their best
                        interest is will not always be obvious, or simple).
                        They will generally be suspicious of things they
                        do not know, but only attack if they feel threatened
                        or they think they will get something from it.

                    Creatures of a certain size will tend to have similar
                    modifiers to their basic combat scores - things such
                    as initiative, attack and defence. Damage is never
                    modified upwards by size, since it comes straight off
                    strength, which goes up with size anyway.

                    <title>Damage</title>

                    <para>
                        There are three types of damage in Yags - stun,
                        wounds and mixed. Wound damage is the most deadly,
                        and is caused by weapons capable of penetrating
                        deep into a target (such as swords and spears).
                        Claws and bites from animals is rarely this deadly,
                        and as such most animals will do either stun or
                        mixed (a mixture of stuns and wounds) damage.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        However, whilst the blow from a whale's tail may
                        be considered stun damage by other whales, to a
                        small human, such damage can be deadly.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If the attacking creature is two size categories
                        larger than the defender, then all damage is
                        shifted up a category in severity. Stun damage
                        becomes mixed, and mixed becomes wound.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If the attacker is four size categories larger than
                        the defender, then all damage is wound damage.
                        A gigantic creature always does wound damage to a
                        medium sized foe.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        There is an exception to this, in that some very
                        large creatures might have attacks which aren't
                        considered quite so large. A huge bulbous beast
                        with lots of writhing tentacles might be colossal
                        in total proportions, but each tentacle might only
                        count as a large attack. If this is the case, then
                        this will be mentioned in the creature description.

                    By default, all medium sized creatures have a
                    basic soak of 12. Larger or smaller creatures
                    can change this however. A huge creature may not
                    be totally immune to damage from normal sized
                    weapons, but they may be too small to do anything
                    other than superficial cuts, which aren't worth
                    even a single wound level.

                    Large creatures will tend to have strengths of

                    Some creatures, especially the larger ones,
                    will have natural armour which helps them soak
                    damage. Natural armour ranges in protection
                    from +0 up to +9, though a creature may have
                    more than one type of natural armour, all of
                    which will stack. For example, a bear has both
                    thick fur and a tough hide.

                <title>Multiple Attacks</title>

                <para>
                    It is normal in Yags for creatures to be only able
                    to make a single attack in a round. In most cases
                    this holds true, and all attacks are collapsed into
                    a single attack and damage roll. A wolf may attack
                    with its teeth and claws, but these are counted as
                    a single attack, directed at a single target.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Some creatures may have several options open to them.
                    An eagle could bite someone annoying it. It could
                    also swoop down and rake with its claws. However, it
                    cannot do both at the same time.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For some things though, this breaks down, especially
                    where fantasy beasts are concerned. A large dragon
                    could bite someone in front of them, knock others
                    down with its tail, and maybe stun those around it
                    with its wings. Subsuming all of these into a single
                    attack wouldn't work, and yet all should be possible
                    each round.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To this end, some creatures are capable of attacking
                    multiple creatures simultaneously. There are two
                    methods this can be done - area attacks, and
                    independent attacks. Independent attacks simply allow
                    the beast to attack two or more times with different
                    types of attack (a bite and a tail bash for instance).
                    Area attacks are a single attack which threatens
                    everyone in an area - a single tail swipe may knock
                    over several people if the beast is huge.

                    <para>
                        An area attack is directed at a single area, and
                        any targets within that area are affected. Tail
                        swipes, tramples and pounce attacks are all
                        examples of possible area attacks from a large
                        creature. Generally, only huge creatures
                        or bigger can make an area attack.

                        When a beast makes an area attack, all people
                        in the area are potential targets. The beast
                        makes a single attack roll, which everyone gets
                        to defend against. Those that succeed fend off,
                        or dodge, the attack. Anyone who is hit takes
                        damage - in each case a seperate damage roll
                        is made.
