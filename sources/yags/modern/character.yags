            <para>
                <e>Yags Modern</e> concerns itself with the modern era,
                from around the time of the 19th century to the 21st
                and onwards. The rules given here are genre neutral,
                and designed to be simple and flexible.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is assumed that you have already read <e>Yags Core</e>,
                since the basic concepts are covered in more detail there.

            <title>Building a Character</title>

            <para>
                Designing a character for <e>Yags Modern</e> is a
                relatively straightforward process. As always, you will
                need a character concept before hand, which will depend
                on the type of campaign being run by the GM, the type
                of characters everybody else is taking, and your
                personal preference.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you have read the core character generation rules,
                ignore them, since they are focused on a fantasy setting
                where characters are more constrained into given roles
                and social classes. Character design in Yags Modern
                provides a great deal of flexibility to allow you to design
                the type of character you want.
            </para>

                <title>Priorities</title>

                <para>
                    Once you have determined the type of character you wish
                    to play, it is time to determine the priorities of that
                    character. There are five broad categories you must
                    place in order of preference - <e>Advantages</e>,
                    <e>Experience</e>, <e>Background</e>,
                    <e>Social class</e> and <e>Wealth</e>.
                    These are described below.
                </para>

                <itemlist order="sort">
                    <item name="Attributes">
                        Points to raise attributes.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Advantages">
                        Covers special abilities which cannot be purchased
                        after character generation as well as raising
                        attributes and skills above their defaults. This
                        area is particularly useful for all-round heroic
                        characters.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Experience">
                        Covers general experience and governs how many
                        skills you start with, as well as the maximum skill
                        level of any one skill at generation time.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Background">
                        This covers what you have done up until this point.
                        It is mostly a way to obtain a package of skills,
                        either through education, military service or
                        business experience. As well as skills, it can
                        provide useful contacts.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Social class">
                        Your social class determines how others view you. A
                        high social rank provides you with a lot of power
                        and responsibility (maybe you are a famous actor or
                        a member of Parliment).
                    </item>

                    <item name="Wealth">
                        Wealth determines how much disposable income you
                        have. A high starting wealth also provides a
                        fortune which can make you financially indepedent.

                    <para>
                        The abilities of cinematic characters tends to be
                        far beyond what most people can hope to achieve in
                        their life time. It is possible to begin as a
                        standard character, and work your way up to being
                        more or less cinematic through experience and
                        training, but sometimes you want to start with a
                        cinematic character especially for a cinematic
                        campaign.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        It is pretty much assumed that cinematic characters
                        are close to the peak of their ability, and won't
                        progress much in their strongest areas once play
                        begins. They may pick up minor skills, and will
                        gain contacts, friends and enemies during the game,
                        but they won't improve as much (relatively speaking)
                        as standard heroes.

                        Attributes are listed as the number of points

                        level is as follows. Attributes above 5 tend to be
                        very rare, and anything above 7 is truly

                    <para>
                        Advantages allow you to buy special abilities for
                        your character, and to raise your attributes beyond
                        the human average. Each rating gives you two values
                        which are shown on the chart as X/Y.

                        The first number gives you the total points of
                        advantages you may purchase for free. The second
                        number is the maximum points of disadvantages you
                        may take - each disadvantage buys you an advantage.

                        Experience gives you experience points which may be
                        spent on pretty much any skill. The table gives two

                        is the maximum skill level any single skill can be
                        raised to.

                        Your background determines what you have been doing
                        up until this point. A background provides a number
                        of benefits, including skills, contacts and possibly
                        equipment. There are a number of backgrounds
                        available, and each has a point cost associated with
                        it. The level of background that you choose defines
                        the number of points you can spend.

                    <para>
                        You may purchase as many backgrounds as you have
                        points for, though you may not take the same
                        background more than once. Where multiple
                        backgrounds provide the same skills, take the
                        highest level of skill provided.
