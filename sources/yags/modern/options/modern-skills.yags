            <para>
                Science covers basic scientific knowledge, logical
                reasoning and ballony detection. Most Western schools will
                teach <e>science</e> to some degree. The skill provides
                basic knowledge of the various sciences, an understanding
                of the philosophy of science, and the ability to tell the
                difference between a scientific theory and dodgy
                pseudo-science.

                Mathematics is the knowledge of advanced mathematics.
                Simple arithmetic is considered to be basic intelligence.
                Mathematics covers geometry, algebra, set theory,
                probability and other branches of mathematics. Most
                children with a Western education will have some
                knowledge of Mathematics after leaving school, though
                it's likely to be only a couple of points.
