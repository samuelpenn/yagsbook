            <para>
                This article describes more detailed combat rules, which
                have yet to make it into the main set of rules for combat.

            <title>New Melee Rules</title>

            <para>
                These rules are either new, or replace the rules given in
                the basic combat rules.
            </para>

                <para>
                    Anyone with a melee combat skill of 1 or more can attempt
                    to show off their prowess with a display of skill. In
                    some cases, this can be used to discourage attackers,
                    ending the fight before it even begins.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The warrior chooses a difficulty - any multiple of 10.
                    The higher the difficulty the more
                    impressive the display, but obviously the harder it is
                    to attempt. The skill check is unaffected by weapon
                    modifiers - simply dexterity and skill.
                </para>

                        This demonstrates that the warrior knows which
                        end of the weapon is which. It won't impress
                        anyone, but it's a beginning.

                    <entry target="20" value="Skilled.">
                        A somewhat impressive display of skill, though
                        nothing out of the ordinary. However, it may cause
                        peasants to think twice before making a move against
                        the warrior.

                    <entry target="30" value="Expert.">
                        A demonstration of skill that most warriors would
                        be hard pressed to achieve.

                    check in order to engage in combat. The difficulty is
                    15 + difference in skill. Failure means they will try to
                    avoid combat, and be at -5 to skills if they do engage,
                    due to fear. Failure by 10 or more means they will try
                    to avoid combat at all costs.

                In any fight, it is possible that both weapons and armour
