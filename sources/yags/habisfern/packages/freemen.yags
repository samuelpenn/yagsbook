        <description>
            <race>Human</race>
            <age>16</age>
            <short>
                Outlaws, thieves and thugs who make a living stealing
                from travellers.
            </short>

            <background>
                <para>
                    You are an outlaw, considered to live outside of the
                    laws of society. You are not constrained by them, but
                    neither are you protected by them. For the most part
                    you survive off the land, hunting and foraging where
                    possible. When the opportunity arises however, you are
                    not above stealing or robbing food and goods from those
                    weaker than yourself.
                </para>

                <para>
                    You are not a warrior, a fact you are well aware of.
                    Your best weapons are surprise and fear, attacking
                    those who are either unable to defend themselves, or
                    when you have a numerical advantage, in the hope that
                    your victims surrender without a fight. You do not
                    seek to fight for what you take, since fighting is
                    risky, and generally not worth it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Your experiences have taught you a mixture of combat,
                    stealth and wilderness skills, though you are well
                    aware that you do not excel at any. Most people like
                    you live in a band of a dozen or so, though sometimes
                    you work alone. Either way, there is little loyalty
                    between bandits, and groups split up and form into
                    other ones on a regular basis.

                    You were raised as a farmer in a free household. As a
                    boy you trained with the local militia, in case you
                    were ever called up to fight in the fyrd in defence of
                    your home. However, your desire is to start a household
                    of your own one day, not to find glory in battle.

                <para>
                    It is assumed that you are living with your parents, or
                    possibly have just settled down with a wife to start a
                    family. The latter means you have land of your own, but
                    also have responsibilites. As the child of a freeman
                    you could get yourself a better start by proving
                    yourself in some way before you settle down. Maybe you
                    will need to find glory after all.

                    Though most women will manage things for their husband,

                    You make your living by being smarter than everyone
                    else. Wit and charm are the tools of your trade,
                    cheating people out of their money so that you can
                    live as you please. It's their fault for being stupid
                    enough to believe your lies.

                    If the opportunity presents itself, then you're not
                    above a bit of burglarly or robbery either. Basically
                    anything which enables you to make a profit and get
                    away before anyone notices without you having to do
                    too much work.

                    You try to look and act respectable, either posing as
                    a travelling merchant, priest or noble. When the time
                    calls for it however, you can just as easily be a
                    vagabound or simpleton, the sort other people will try
                    to cheat, and in so doing, open themselves up to being
                    cheated themselves.

                    Once, either you or your family was considered to be a
                    free farmer, with land and responsibilities. Things
                    became hard however, and you lost everything. Rather
                    than giving up your freedom, you left to wander the
                    land, begging, stealing or even working for food.

                    Whether you live by crime or not, many other vagabounds
                    do, and so you will be mistrusted and disliked. However,
                    where you can be used as cheap labor, you will be
                    welcomed - at least until the time when you ask for
                    payment.

                <para>
                    You are not quite an outlaw, though in practise your
                    position in society is very similar. Few will care if
                    you turn up dead, and nobody will avenge you. You will
                    be treated worse than a slave, but at the end of the
                    day you have your freedom.
