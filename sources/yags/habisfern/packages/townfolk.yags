                A thug is a town dweller, living by the maxim that might
                is right. Often, might is all they have. They are normally
                part of a street gang, or working for a crime boss. Some
                find honest work hired by a shopkeeper or merchant.

            <short>
                The street thief is a pickpocket, con man and general
                nuisance. They are generally found in towns and cities,

            <short>
                Prostitutes are women selling their bodies for cash. They
                may be found anywhere, though tend to be more obvious in
                towns. They may take to thieving from their clients if they
                think they can get away with it, and can be useful spies
                or sources of information.

    <character name="Watchman">
        <description>
            <short>
                The town watch try and keep order within the town. They are
                often not skilled warriors, but are given a weapon and some
                armour and told to enforce the peace. However, they are not
                expected to take on trained warriors, just general town
                low life which is more likely to run than stay and fight.
                Not being able to catch and corner criminals is a good
                survival trait for most watchmen.
