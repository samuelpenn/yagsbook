            <para>
                The World of Men, also known as the Middle Earth, is seen
                as solid and real, something which can be touched, felt and
                understood by everyone. Where man has built places to live,
                where cut wood and shaped stone mark the mark of civilisation,
                so the strength of the real world is greatest.
            </para>

            <para>
                Man though does not have full control over all things, and
                the further one goes from the shaped and bounded places
                which men call home, the thinner the walls are between this
                world and the <e>Dream Lands</e>. At night, the spirits of
                these other lands find a way into civilised areas though
                the dreams of men. In the unseen darkness and shadows of
                night, the rule of men is undone.
            </para>

            <para>
                Not all men though fear these other realms, there are some
                are actively seek them out, and try to command the powers
                that lay within them to do their bidding. Such people are
                commonly called Wizards, and with runes and words of power
                they can awaken the dream lands, and reshape the world of
                men to their bidding. With understanding though comes a
                price, for your mind cannot understand both the world of
                dreams and the world of men at the same time.
            </para>


            <para>
                The Wizards of Habisfern are descendants of runesmiths
                and shamans from older times. Their magic is simple and
                straightforward, and for the most part it deals with
                the problems faced by everyone day to day. <e>Anybody</e>
                can learn and use magic, though the path can be
                difficulty and corruption and insanity are the prices
                to be paid for careless use of these powers.
            </para>

            <para>
                For this reason, Wizards are somewhat feared, and
                definitely distrusted. Too many have gone over the edge,
                giving in to the nightmares which fill their sleep, their
                mind linked too closely to the Otherworld, leaving them
                unable to function sanely in the middle lands.

                <title>The Realms</title>

                <para>
                    The world of men is known as the Middle Earth, since
                    all other realms lay above and below it. It is a realm
                    of physical things, though in places it can be warped
                    where another realm touches upon it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Below the Middle Earth is the <e>Under Earth</e>, also
                    known as the Realm of the Dead. It is said to be either
                    a huge cavern below all other places, or a maze of
                    twisty tunnels which are designed to confuse and trap
                    those who venture there. It is a quiet and empty place,
                    for most who come here do not last long, their spirits
                    soon being reborn back in the Middle Earth or with the
                    gods.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To the other side of the Under Earth is the Other
                    World. This is the realm of living spirits, of
                    elementals and fey. It is from here that the power
                    of magic is normally drawn. It is a place of dreams,
                    easily molded to the wishes of those in it.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Some place the Gods in the Other World, others place
                    them in a fourth realm which is beyond the Other World
                    in an even more distant place.

                    Those who wield magical power are known by many
                    names. Collectively, they tend to be known as
                    Wizards.

                <title>The Mysteries</title>

                <para>
                    Knowledge of magic is divided into seven
                    <e>Mysteries</e>, each of which grants the wizard power
                    over one part of the world. A wizard may learn any
                    number of Mysteries, though many only bother learning
                    one or two. Six of the Mysteries are considered to be
                    related to each other, being thought of as forming a
                    circle. Mysteries on opposite sides of the circle
                    oppose each other, and mastery of one will limit
                    ability in the other.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The six main Mysteries are <e>Spirit</e>, <e>Water</e>,
                    <e>Earth</e>, <e>Iron</e>, <e>Fire</e> and <e>Air</e>.
                    There is a seventh, called <e>Dragon</e>, which stands
                    separate to the others. It cannot be learnt until the
                    others have been understood to a sufficient degree,
                    and it gives power over the fundamental reality of the
                    world. The nature of <e>Dragon</e> is not described in
                    this article, for its powers are unknown to most wizards.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Once a Mystery has been learnt, then it can be used in
                    one of three ways - to <e>Sense</e>, to <e>Control</e>
                    or to <e>Summon</e>. These are the core powers of the
                    Mystery, and can be used without further study.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A wizard may also study and learn <e>Cantrips</e>.
                    These are short words of power which can be used to
                    focus the magic in a particular way. Cantrips are
                    more specialised than the core powers, but can be
                    more powerful. Learning Cantrips, especially the
                    higher level ones, can be very difficult however.
                    The number of Cantrips is limited, and there is
                    no known way for a mortal to create a new Cantrip.

                <title>The Price of Magic</title>

                <para>
                    Knowledge of magic comes with a price - the more a
                    mortal knows, the closer they get to becoming part of
                    the Otherworld. This change affects their mind, making
                    them act in ways not entirely consistent with rational
                    behaviour. They go insane.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Insanity has its benefits though. The more insane a
                    wizard is, the greater the power they can call upon.
                    However, insanity of this kind attracts spirits from
                    the Otherworld which would try to take advantage of the
                    wizard's weakened state. The wizard is most vulnerable
                    whilst he sleeps, making it unhealthy for a wizard to
                    use magic just before bedtime.

            <title>Understanding the Mysteries</title>

            <para>
                Magic divides the world into six areas, each governed by
                one of the <e>Mysteries</e>. Each Mystery has its place
                in the structure of magic, with neighbouring Mysteries
                strengthening each other, and distant Mysteries at odds
                with each other. They can be thought of as being in a ring,
                starting with <e>Spirit</e>, and moving through
                <e>Water</e>, <e>Earth</e>, <e>Iron</e>, <e>Fire</e>
                to <e>Air</e>. The Word of <e>Spirit</e> is related to
                <e>Air</e> and <e>Water</e>, and opposed to <e>Iron</e>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Each Mystery can be used in one of three ways - to
                <e>Sense</e>, to <e>Control</e> or to <e>Summon</e>.
            </para>

                <title>Learning a Mystery</title>

                <para>
                    A wizard who has learnt (not Mastered) a Mystery to a
                    level of 10 may teach it to another. There is no
                    restriction on who can learn a Mystery, but Wizards
                    will generally only teach those they find agreeable
                    and to be quick witted. Training takes a month, and
                    at the end of that time the student must make an
                    intelligence test at a target of 20. Success means
                    that they have learnt the Mystery at a level of 1.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Imparting the knowledge of magic costs both the
                    teacher and student one point of permanent Luck,
                    regardless of whether the attempt is successful.

                <title>Mastering a Mystery</title>

                <para>
                    When a wizard achieves a score of 10 in a Mystery for the
                    first time, then they are considered to have
                    automatically <e>Mastered</e> that Mystery. A Wizard will
                    only ever Master a single Mystery, and does not get the
                    option to not Master when they first obtain a score of 10.
                    After the first has been Mastered, the wizard may raise
                    other Words to 10 and beyond without any special effect.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A Master is considered to have a deep knowledge and
                    understanding of the realm of magic that the Mystery
                    represents. The magic also takes mastery of them to
                    some extent as well, which is why they do not get a
                    choice about Mastery.
                </para>

                <para>
                    On achieving Mastery, the Arch Wizard may choose one
                    of the special advantages that become open to them.
                    This is a free bonus, which does not need to be paid
                    for. The advantage provides an ability that is free
                    for the Arch Wizard to use at will.
                    Further advantages may be chosen at a skill level of
                    12, 15 and every 5 points thereafter, but only in the
                    Mystery that has been Mastered.
                </para>

                <para>
                    There is a downside to Mastery, in that the directly
                    opposed Mystery is negatively affected, gaining a -1 to
                    Will when using magic associated with that Mystery. When
                    the second Mastery level is taken, then a further -1
                    is suffered. The two indirectly opposed Mysteries suffer
                    a penalty equal to half (round down) the main penalty.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the Wizard's gender matches the affinity of the
                    Mystery (e.g. a female wizard mastering <e>Earth</e>),
                    then the first level of penalty is ignored, and the
                    first -1 is gained when they reach a skill of 12.
                    Further, the wizard may select <e>two</e> advantages
                    when they first master the Mystery.
                </para>

                <example title="How Mastery Works">
                    <para>
                        For example, a wizard raises his Earth to 10. At this
                        point he gets to choose a single Mastery Ability.
                        Because it is Air that is opposed to Earth, the wizard
                        now has a -1 to their <t>Will</t> when using Air magic.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If they raise their Earth to 12, then they choose a
                        second Mastery ability, and now have a -2 to Air. They
                        will also suffer -1 to Spirit and Fire.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If the wizard had been female, then on achieving a
                        level of 10 in Earth, they would get their mastery
                        ability, but would not suffer a penalty to Air. When
                        their Earth reaches 12, they suffer a -1 to Air.

                <para>
                    When using one of the powers of a Mystery, a skill
                    check is made using <y:will>Mystery</y:will> against
                    either a straight difficulty of 10 or the <y:will/> of

                    Though most wizards keep to using the basic powers of
                    the Mysteries, a few strive to gain a deeper knowledge
                    of magic, by learning <e>cantrips</e>. A cantrip is a
                    simple invocation which is associated with a Mystery,
                    and which provides a simple magical effect. Simple does
                    not mean weak however, and some cantrips are capable
                    of destroying a town or slaying someone with a word.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each cantrip must be learnt seperately, and is treated
                    as a <e>technique</e>, in that they have a prerequisite
                    of a skill level and other cantrips. However, they
                    cannot be simply purchased with experience, but must
                    be learnt through meditation and self-sacrifice.

                        Most cantrips can be invoked in a single round, and
                        require little in the way of gestures or
                        incantations. Cantrips are described under the
                        section for the individual Mysteries, and they all
                        follow the same format. An example cantrip is given

                The Mystery of <e>Spirit</e> gives the wizard control over
                the realm of spirits, souls and minds. It is the realm
                of seekers after knowledge, and the haunts of ghosts.

                        examine the spirits of those around her. All living
                        things have a spirit, and all spirits have an aura.
                        The aura is a reflection of the spirit's true
                        nature, and is difficult to mask.

                        Targets with a <t>Will</t> get a resistance, other

                    <para>
                        A useful ritual is to enscribe a warding circle
                        which acts as a focus for the magic. As well as
                        giving the standard ritual benefits, it prevents
                        all spirits from passing across its perimeter
                        if they fail their resistance. It can have a radius
                        up to a number of metres equal to the skill of
                        the wizard. Using a circle gives an all or nothing
                        result - either a spirit can pass the perimeter,
                        or it can't. It is useful for protecting a group
                        of people, or to contain a spirit.

                            time. How long it remains depends on the
                            personality of the spirit and how well the
                            body is preserved.

                    <e>Iron</e> represents strength and toughness, and
                    <e>Control Iron</e> grants the wizard control over
                    their own nature, toughening their body. By
                    concentrating for a minute, the wizard can give
                    themselves a +5 to soak for each level of success,
                    but at a cost of -1 to agility and dexterity. Two
                    success can be used to give a soak bonus without
                    the penalty.

                    The effect lasts as long as the wizard concentrates
                    or until they are wounded. Each time they take a
                    wound (not stuns), their soak bonus drops by 5. Any
                    penalties are lost as soon as they loose their last
                    bonus. Other side effects mean that the wizard
                    looses all sense of touch, and is heavier, making
                    them unable to swim.

                <para>
                    <e>Sense Fire</e> enables the wizard to see
                    visions through fires. By looking into a fire, the
                    wizard can see out of another fire within sight
                    (i.e. the wizard must be able to see both fires).
                    The distance to the next fire impacts on the
                    quality of the vision. If it is more than 10 metres
                    away, then the wizard is at -10. Each multiple of
                    10 (100m, 1km, 10km) reduces the roll by a further
                    -10.

                    The size of the smallest of the two fires also
                    reduces the quality of the vision. A large camp
                    fire or larger is needed for best quality. A small
                    camp fire reduces the quality by one level, a
                    torch by two levels and a candle by three levels.

                            or trying to attack or dodge.

                            You are severly depressed, and see no reason to
                            act or do anything. If there is a good reason to
                            move, then you must make a Will check at a target
                            of 30 to do so. More focused actions (fighting,
                            using magic) is impossible.
