                This skill grants the knowledge of runes, and how to use
                them in magic and the telling of fortunes. With this
                skill you can craft and read runes and determine their
                meaning. You are also able to use them in the telling
                of a person's fortune. You can only actually fortell
                the future if you have the <e>Divination</e> advantage.

            <para>
                Casting runes for a person, in order to determine their
                future, can be performed with <t>Empathy</t> and requires
                no special magical talent. It is effectively a cold
                reading, based on what is likely to be believed.

            <para>
                Generally, when performing divination attempts, the example
                difficulty will provide minimal information. A good
                success will provide more information, and an excellent
                success will provide quite detailed information.
