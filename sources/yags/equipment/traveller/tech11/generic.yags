                toughens into a flexible, skin-tight gel that can keep you
                warm and covered. Available in anything from swimwear to
                cold weather clothing forms, it can be used either for
                emergencies or as a fashion statement. May be transparent
                or coloured. Some varieties provide a small amount of
                armour. Method of removal depends on brand, but can be
                anything from plain water to special chemicals or just
                ripping it off.

            <para>
                For when the latest fashion requires a certain look, changeling
                skin provides a quick and easy way to change your appearance.
                Sprayed onto your skin, it forms into a gell that grafts onto
                your skin providing a colouring and texture of your desires.
                Once set (takes about 15 minutes), it lasts from a few hours
                to a couple of days depending on how active you are.

        <short>Holographic clothing belt.</short>
        <description>
            <para>
                This belt consists of holographic projectors capable of
                displaying the illusion of clothing around a person. The
                holograms are unable to provide any actual warmth or
                texture, but can cover up nudity, or add to existing
                simple clothing. When used as a fashion item, it is
                common to wear underwear beneath the hologram, and have
                programmable clothing ontop of that. Clothing style can
                be changed either automatically or manually.
            </para>

            <para>
                The holographic clothing will move with you, and can be
                programmed to simulate wind or gravitational effects as
                desired. A clothing belt isn't good as a disguise, except
                in certain edge cases (possibly combat, or modifying
                something already worn). It's actually best in brightly
                lit conditions, since the hologram radiates light and
                looks obviously like a hologram in darkness.

        <short>Shuts down and preserves the brain.</short>

        <description>
            <para>
                This is a nano/drug combination which is designed to keep
                you alive if your body goes into shock. Nanomachines are
                injected into the bloodstream which attach themselves to
                blood vessels in the brain. If they detect conditions
                (normally sharp drop in oxygen levels) that suggest the
                body is dying, they release a large dose of preservatives
                which drop the brain into a state of suspended animation.
                If you fail a <t>Health</t> check and die, this drug can
                keep you alive for another 24 hours.
            </para>

            <para>
                Revival can only be performed at a medical facility, and
                is a tricky process (medicine check of 40+ assuming the
                correct equipment is available). The nanites last a day
                before disintigrating and releasing the chemicals in a
                neutral form which are flushed out of the body.
            </para>

                TL12 versions of this last a week, and can preserve you
                for 72 hours. Revival at a facility is only difficulty
                20+, but revival in the field is possible at a check of
                40+, if suitable drugs are carried.

            <para>
                A swarm of microbots which when released cover an area up to
                100m^2. They are able to locate most forms of electronic
                devices, including sensors, mines, power cables and
                transmitters. They take about a minute to cover the area,
                and due to their small size (a few millimetres long) rarely
                trigger what they are looking for.
            </para>

            <para>
                They can rely results back using either short burst comms,
                lights or returning to base. They have enough power for
                about 30 minutes use. At TL12, they can operate for 2 hours
                and add +10 to their skill.

        <description>
            <para>
                Designed to cover an area up to 1000m^2, a swarm of
                alarm microbots is able to act as an effective
                alarm system without requiring much time setting up.
                When deployed, they automatically spread out to cover
                their programmed area. If they detect movement, sound
                or light (programmable) they can respond with either
                a short communication burst, or in 'siren' mode by
                the swarm lighting up around the disturbance and
                producing a wailing siren.

                simultaneously causing damage to all within the area.
                They cause up to +75 (Vehicle) damage, -1 for each 4m^2
                of area that is covered.
