                or sometimes against infantry.

        <description>
            <para>
                This vehicle mounted gauss weapon is designed for use
                against infantry rather than as an anti-armour weapon.
                Per-round, it lacks the stopping power of the chaingun,
                but is more than capable of suppressing and/or killing
                any infantry that come into range.
