        <description>
            <para>
                A compact laser rifle with a high rate of fire and enough
                power to hold 60 shots. It manages to obtain this combination
                by reducing the size of the focusing lens, which has resulted
                in reduced range.
            </para>

            <para>
                Though it is well suited for close combat, its lower damage
                potential is seen as a major downside. To offset this, it
                does have a <e>high power</e> mode, which allows a single
                shot to be fired at +5 damage, though this takes up 10 times
                the charge of a normal shot.

        <short>Rapid fire plasma rifle.</short>

        <description>
            <para>
                This weapon is competing with the T45 for becoming the next
                standard small arms weapon for the Imperium army. It uses
                a small plasma discharge accelerated to high velocity as
                the projectile. It has good penetrating ability and a high
                rate of fire, coupled with an exceptional capacity for a
                weapon of its size.
            </para>

            <para>
                The main problem is the range and accuracy, both of which
                are poor compared to the KG56 range of gauss rifles.
                The manufacturer is promising that future versions will
                fix these problems.
            </para>

            <para>
                Laser sights, built in IFF and night vision scopes come as
                standard on all models. It is not currently compatible with
                underslung grenade launchers, however experimental models
                have demonstrated an 'explosive pulse' firing option which
                is claimed to remove the need for grenades.
