            <para>
                The technology levels which <s>Yags</s> uses to denote the
                type of technology available sets the modern era (the early
                21st century) to be TL 8. Anything prior to this period is
                historical, anything after it is conjecture. The following
                sections detail the sort of technology possible in the far
                future, starting at TL 9 (2020 - late 21st) and going up to
                TL 16 or so (interstellar civilisations).
            </para>

            <para>
                Everything here is suited to <e>SciFi</e> style campaigns,
                with faster than light travel, ridiculous energy production
                and weird new forms of matter. It may be suitable for
                campaigns built around <e>Traveller</e> , <e>Babylon 5</e>
                or the <e>Foundation</e> series, though isn't particularly
                suited to settings such as those of <e>Revalation Space</e>
                by Alastair Reynolds or <e>Queendom of Sol</e> by Wil McCarthy.
                It's aimed at the harder end of Hollywood SciFi, rather than
                the type of futures portrayed in modern SF books.

            <title>The Near Future (TL 9)</title>

            <para>
                The progression of technology through the 21st century has
                been one of iterative improvements over what has gone before.
                There's little which is completely unexpected, though changes
                to society would not have been expected in early TL 8.
            </para>

                    Everybody is part of the network, and everything is in the
                    cloud. Social networks link everybody to everyone else, and
                    your reputation and friends are governed by your standing
                    on these social networks. Privacy crumbles under the onslaught
                    of location based services, advertising and automated status
                    updates. As new generations are born into this world, and
                    find the idea of sharing your life, thoughts and loves with
                    everybody else perfectly natural, keeping a lid on commentary
                    becomes impossible.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Part of this new world is aided by the invention of superior
                    new energy storage technologies, so even the most power hungry
                    smart phones can last a week between recharges. Consistency
                    between power sockets and network links also becomes necessary,
                    and possible once requirements begin to stabilise.
                </para>

                <para>
                    On a larger scale, there is a greater use of energy sources
                    such as solar, wind and tidal power as a more flexible and
                    distributed power grid is developed. Fossil fuels are still
                    heavily used, though high performance electric cars begin to
                    become practical with better batteries. Towards the end of
                    TL 9, fusion power starts to come online, though most power
                    stations are proof of concept designs serving small towns.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In space, new forms of drive technology based around plasma
                    and ion designs come into use. There is limited colonisation
                    of the solar system, and industrial, medical and tourist use
                    of orbital facilities.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Genetic engineering becomes the norm on a large scale,
                    greatly improving the availability of food. Genetic disorders
                    can be cured prior to birth and for the wealthy life
                    expectancy rises consistently above 100. Cybernetics improves,
                    with lost limbs and other organs being replaced by artificial
                    devices as good as, if not better than, the original thing.
                </para>

                <title>Weapons</title>

                <para>
                    The killing ability of man portable weapons plateaus during
                    late TL8 and early TL9. The lack of progress in personal
                    armour means there isn't a necessity for weapons to become
                    more deadly. Instead, they are lighter, more reliable and
                    somewhat cleverer.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Most small arms switch to case-less ammunition, with some
                    larger rifles moving to gauss or even laser. For the most
                    part, the good old chemical powered slug thrower is still the
                    most efficient in terms of weight, cost and effectiveness.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Armour becomes a bit lighter and a bit more effective, but
                    not by much. Richer nations can afford powered hard shell
                    armour towards the end of TL9, but since they're also the
                    ones making the newer weapons and they're only going up
                    against lightly armoured opponents there isn't a drive to
                    modify small arms to be effective against such targets.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Smart weapons, capable of automatically calculating the range
                    to a target, and setting explosive timers themselves do become
                    common. Networked battlefields, combining light artillery,
                    drones and net-enabled combat troopers can bring effective
                    fire down on an enemy position quickly and technically without
                    human intervention.

            <title>The Whole Planet (TL 10)></title>

            <para>
                Some time in TL 10, civilisation becomes Type I on the
                <e>Kardashev Scale</e>, achieving mastery of the resources
                of its home planet. Energy production and consumption is
                considerably beyond what was available in TL 8, and continues
                to grow beyond expectations.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>A TL 10 Culture</title>

                <para>
                    By TL 10 cities are smart. Automated surveillance is
                    everywhere, monitoring where people are and what they are
                    doing. This flow of information allows for a degree of
                    efficiency not seen before, but also limits the privacy
                    available to everyone. Many people record their whole
                    lives, video and audio captured though implants inserted
                    soon after birth. The legal ramifications are massive,
                    and there's either a crack down on such technology or
                    an opening up of restrictions on what can be recorded
                    (and played back for public consumption).
                </para>

                <para>
                    Fusion power is the most common form of large scale power
                    generation, but power is reclaimed via other means on a
                    smaller scale. Solar, tidal and wind power grabs what it
                    can and feeds it into national energy grids in a greatly
                    distributed system of power generation. Highly efficient
                    energy storage systems can store power locally, minimising
                    the effects of national failures, and reducing the need
                    to crank up large scale generation during short term spikes
                    in demand.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Everybody is connected, and access to information is pretty
                    global. Wireless communication connects most devices - long
                    range for access to news and information, short range for
                    eCash transfers. The technology is there to support
                    automatic micro-transactions for most services, which could
                    replace some forms of taxation if the will is there.
                </para>

                <para>
                    As well as smart devices, there is smart textiles which can
                    change colour and texture based on environment and body state.
                    Smart composites make for good body armour which can switch
                    from flexible to stiff as a bullet tries to penetrate. For
                    that matter, smart bullets which can control their trajectory
                    and behaviour depending on the type of target they've hit
                    are also available.

                    Replacement organs can be grown in vats, genetically programmed
                    to match the host recipient within hours of being implanted.
                    Regrowth of limbs is possible, though expensive, and for a
                    price pretty much any disease can be cured. Drugs and nano
                    machines for physical enhancement also exist.

                <para>
                    In space, efficient and fast drive systems allow trade between
                    worlds within a star system, and orbital and planetary colonies
                    are common. Towards the latter part of the TL, the first Jump
                    drives are constructed, allowing travel to distant stars.
