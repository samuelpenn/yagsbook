                It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that is
                the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision
                can be made any longer without taking into account not only

                This is the future of Hollywood Science Fiction. Actually,
                it's not quite that bad, but the <e>SciFi</e> label is used
                to describe a future more suited to action and adventure
                amongst interstellar communities, than to one embedded in
                a virtual reality simulation running in a Matrioshka Brain.
                Laser guns and space ships if you like, rather than hard
                science fiction.

                <s>Yags</s> measures the technology available to a campaign
                with technology levels (TLs), where the modern era around
                the start of the 21st millennium is TL 8. For the technology
                of the 20th century, see <e>Yags High Tech</e>, and other
                articles will cover earlier periods. TL 9 and above are in
                the realms of the future, so is purely fictional.

                Everything here is suited to <e>SciFi</e> style campaigns,
                with faster than light travel, ridiculous energy production
                and weird new forms of matter. It may be suitable for
                campaigns built around <e>Traveller</e>, <e>Babylon 5</e>
                or the <e>Foundation</e> series, though isn't particularly
                suited to settings such as those of <e>Revalation Space</e>
                by Alastair Reynolds or <e>Queendom of Sol</e> by Wil McCarthy.
                It's aimed at the harder end of Hollywood SciFi, rather than
                the type of futures portrayed in modern SF books. If you want
                a harder, grittier future than <e>Ultra Tech</e> will be
                designed to cover this, following a branch of future
                technology where computational power is not restricted by
                storytelling requirements.

                The big requirement here is that the future is still about people.
                Computer technology is limited so that humanity doesn't
                vanish up its own singularity, thereby preventing the ability
                to have high adventure in interstellar communities.

                    <para>
                        This covers the technology that becomes available
                        over the rest of the 21st century, from about 2020
                        to 2100. Computers continue to improve, genetics and
                        medical science make some great leaps but the biggest
                        change is in energy storage, which is needed to power
                        the smart devices of the future.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Guns still fire bullets, mostly with the help of
                        chemical explosions.

                    <para>
                        By TL 10 we can consume the whole energy resources of
                        a planet, with a combination of fission, fusion, solar
                        and other power sources. Interplanetary travel becomes
                        easy, but the limits of computational technology are
                        being approached. By the end of TL 10, the first FTL
                        drives are developed. Bodily organs can be grown on
                        demand in vats, as can food.

                        Guns fire bullets, often propelled by EM gauss effects.

                        Star travel becomes reliable as the technology improves,
                        but it is still slow. Computer technology is approaching
                        a stasis, but medical science is removing the need for
                        cybernetics, allowing limb re-growth and some limited
                        anti-agathics.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Gauss and laser weapons tend to be equally common, and
                        materials tech starts to improve body armour. In space,
                        lasers and particle beams dominate.

                    <para>
                        Star travel becomes faster, and cheaper. Manipulation of
                        the weak force allows for nuclear damper technology, and
                        new forms of matter can be created. Medical technology
                        has improved to the point where most things are survivable
                        if you can get to a hospitable in time. Cybernetics seems
                        like a passing fad, since organic replacements can be
                        just as good.

                        required, anti-matter is the way to go.

                        unattainable. Interstellar travel is cheap and readily
                        available, and much industry is now placed in orbit.

                The progression of technology through the 21st century has
                been one of iterative improvements over what has gone before.
                There's little which is completely unexpected, though changes

                    Everybody is part of the network, and everything is in the
                    cloud. Social networks link everybody to everyone else, and
                    your reputation and friends are governed by your standing
                    on these social networks. Privacy crumbles under the onslaught
                    of location based services, advertising and automated status
                    updates. As new generations are born into this world, and
                    find the idea of sharing your life, thoughts and loves with
                    everybody else perfectly natural, keeping a lid on commentary
                    becomes impossible.

                <para>
                    Part of this new world is aided by the invention of superior
                    new energy storage technologies, so even the most power hungry
                    smart phones can last a week between recharges. Consistency
                    between power sockets and network links also becomes necessary,
                    and possible once requirements begin to stabilise.
                </para>

                <para>
                    On a larger scale, there is a greater use of energy sources
                    such as solar, wind and tidal power as a more flexible and
                    distributed power grid is developed. Fossil fuels are still
                    heavily used, though high performance electric cars begin to
                    become practical with better batteries. Towards the end of
                    TL 9, fusion power starts to come online, though most power
                    stations are proof of concept designs serving small towns.

                <para>
                    In space, new forms of drive technology based around plasma
                    and ion designs come into use. There is limited colonisation
                    of the solar system, and industrial, medical and tourist use
                    of orbital facilities.

                    Genetic engineering becomes the norm on a large scale,
                    greatly improving the availability of food. Genetic disorders
                    can be cured prior to birth and for the wealthy life
                    expectancy rises consistently above 100. Cybernetics improves,
                    with lost limbs and other organs being replaced by artificial
                    devices as good as, if not better than, the original thing.

                <para>
                    The killing ability of man portable weapons plateaus during
                    late TL8 and early TL9. The lack of progress in personal
                    armour means there isn't a necessity for weapons to become
                    more deadly. Instead, they are lighter, more reliable and
                    somewhat cleverer.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Most small arms switch to case-less ammunition, with some
                    larger rifles moving to gauss or even laser. For the most
                    part, the good old chemical powered slug thrower is still the
                    most efficient in terms of weight, cost and effectiveness.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Armour becomes a bit lighter and a bit more effective, but
                    not by much. Richer nations can afford powered hard shell
                    armour towards the end of TL9, but since they're also the
                    ones making the newer weapons and they're only going up
                    against lightly armoured opponents there isn't a drive to
                    modify small arms to be effective against such targets.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Smart weapons, capable of automatically calculating the range
                    to a target, and setting explosive timers themselves do become
                    common. Networked battlefields, combining light artillery,
                    drones and net-enabled combat troopers can bring effective
                    fire down on an enemy position quickly and technically without
                    human intervention.

                    By TL 10 cities are smart. Automated surveillance is
                    everywhere, monitoring where people are and what they are
                    doing. This flow of information allows for a degree of
                    efficiency not seen before, but also limits the privacy
                    available to everyone. Many people record their whole
                    lives, video and audio captured though implants inserted
                    soon after birth. The legal ramifications are massive,
                    and there's either a crack down on such technology or
                    an opening up of restrictions on what can be recorded

                    Fusion power is the most common form of large scale power
                    generation, but power is reclaimed via other means on a
                    smaller scale. Solar, tidal and wind power grabs what it
                    can and feeds it into national energy grids in a greatly
                    distributed system of power generation. Highly efficient
                    energy storage systems can store power locally, minimising
                    the effects of national failures, and reducing the need
                    to crank up large scale generation during short term spikes
                    in demand.

                    Everybody is connected, and access to information is pretty
                    global. Wireless communication connects most devices - long
                    range for access to news and information, short range for
                    eCash transfers. The technology is there to support
                    automatic micro-transactions for most services, which could
                    replace some forms of taxation if the will is there.

                    As well as smart devices, there is smart textiles which can
                    change colour and texture based on environment and body state.
                    Smart composites make for good body armour which can switch
                    from flexible to stiff as a bullet tries to penetrate. For
                    that matter, smart bullets which can control their trajectory
                    and behaviour depending on the type of target they've hit
                    are also available.

                    Replacement organs can be grown in vats, genetically programmed
                    to match the host recipient within hours of being implanted.
                    Regrowth of limbs is possible, though expensive, and for a
                    price pretty much any disease can be cured. Drugs and nano
                    machines for physical enhancement also exist.

                    In space, efficient and fast drive systems allow trade between
                    worlds within a star system, and orbital and planetary colonies
                    are common. Towards the latter part of the TL, the first Jump
                    drives are constructed, allowing travel to distant stars.

                    The biggest shift in weapons technologies comes not from
                    weapons, but from armour. Flexible but strong armour which
                    can react to absorb and dissipate damage becomes possible
                    and common. This in turn requires more powerful small arms
                    to keep infantry effective.

                    Larger calibre chemical slug throwers are still used in
                    pistols and assault rifles, but gauss and laser weapons
                    become the norm in larger rifles. Battle rifles come
                    equipped with smart ammunition.
