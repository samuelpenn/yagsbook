        <short>20mm Gatling cannon.</short>
        <description>
            <para>
                First produced in 1959 by General Electric, the M61 Vulcan is
                a six barreled, air-cooled, electrically fired Gatling style
                cannon, capable of firing 20mm rounds at 6000rpm, with a
                muzzle velocity of just over 1km/s. The original specification
                was for an aircraft mounted cannon capable of hitting other
                high speed targets.
            </para>

            <para>
                It uses a linkless feed system, and has the option of either
                ejecting or retaining spent cases. The latter is useful on
                aircraft where ejected cases have potential to damage the
                engine.
            </para>

            <para>
                There is a self-powered version, the GAU-4 (or M130) which is
                gas operated. This is 4.5kg heavier, but otherwise similar in
                capability.

        <short>30mm Gatling cannon.</short>
        <description>
            <para>
                A 7 barreled rotary cannon capable of firing 30mm rounds at
                4,200 rpm with a velocity of 1km/s. It is the principle
                weapon of the A-10 Warthog, a close combat aircraft designed
                for tank hunting, amongst other things.
            </para>

            <para>
                Typically, the magazine is loaded with a mixture of armour
                piercing and high explosive rounds for maximum effectiveness
                against armoured targets.
