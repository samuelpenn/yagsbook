        <description>
            <para>
                Assault rifle designed to use caseless ammunition. It uses
                a larger round to provide better effectiveness against
                body armour, plus has the option of an under slung grenade
                launcher with 3x40mm grenades. An automatic range finder can
                adjust the sights to improve targeting of standard fire,
                plus auto-detonation of the grenades.
            </para>

            <para>
                It has single shot, full auto and 3-round burst modes, the
                latter of which is sometimes the only option in some models.

            <para>
                Light assault rifle firing a smaller round that is still
                effective against unarmoured targets. It is very light
                and reliable, and commonly found as the principle weapon
                of first world armies, as well as in the hands of third
                world militia.

            <para>
                A rifle designed for longer range engagements than what
                the more compact assault rifles are used for. It is
                limited to semi-automatic and 3-round burst fire, since
                fully automatic fire at greater ranges isn't viewed as
                being useful.

        <description>
            <para>
                The ISW 400 is an early to mid TL 9 design which fills the
                role of a Squad Assault Weapon. It can provide a high rate
                of automatic fire over a long range, with active cooling
                systems which enable a sustained rate of fire over a long
                period. It is designed to be used with either a bipod or
                tripod, since it is too heavy for most people to use by
                itself.
            </para>

            <para>
                The high rate of fire requires a large supply of ammunition,
                which is not included in the weapon weight.
            </para>.

            <para>
                A well known brand of automatic pistol that is available
                pretty much everywhere, due its low cost and ease of
                manufacture. There are many knock-off variants, though
                most differences are superficial.
            </para>

            <para>
                Higher tech versions may have built in laser scopes and
                round selectors to allow multiple ammunition types. A
                high capacity magazine (20 rounds) is also available.

        <description>
            <para>
                This is a heavy rifle which fires a solid metal slug using an
                electromagnetic impulse. Such gauss weapons start to become
                available towards the end of TL9, and are found in specialist
                roles such as snipers rifles, where the smooth acceleration
                of the round, and lack of explosive gases, provides greater
                accuracy.

        <short>Heavy laser rifle.</short>
        <description>
            <para>
                The ILS-2000 becomes production ready in late TL 9. It is
                designed as a sniper's rifle, though has advantages and
                disadvantages compared to similar solid slug designs. It
                isn't as powerful as the alternatives, but its accuracy
                over range is much greater (though effective range isn't
                as great as standard sniper rifles).
            </para>

            <para>
                It is heavy, unwieldy, has a low rate of fire and limited
                capacity. However, it is unaffected by wind and gravity
                (though moist air can seriously limit range) and can pass
                through windows unaffected, making it an excellent
                assassination tool.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is possible to disable safety features to produce an
                overpowered shot. RoF drops to 1, but each extra charge
                used in the shot does +2 damage, with a +1 increase in
                fumble chance. On a fumble, the weapon burns out and is
                rendered inoperable (sometimes explosively) rather than
                firing.
