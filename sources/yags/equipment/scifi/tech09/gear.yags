        <description>
            <para>
                A lightweight ballistic vest constructed of a variety of
                materials to provide a combination of flexibility and
                ability to absorb damage. It's main advantage over
                earlier designs is the greatly reduced weight for only
                a minor reduction in protective ability.

                against small arms fire.

        <description>
            <para>
                A late TL9 design of full body armour for protection
                against ballistic weapons, using the latest in
                composite materials. It is capable of providing some
                protection against high powered rifles and light
                machine guns, unlike previous designs.

        <short>Smart phone.</short>
        <description>
            <para>
                A typical smart phone of the type available in early TL9.
                It has voice and data capability, plus about 1TB+ of
                data storage. It almost certainly has a touch screen and
                may have a small keyboard. Battery life will be in the
                order of a week, depending on capabilities, and can be
                recharged by cable or short-range wireless power (since
                most vehicles and homes provide this, users rarely have
                to actively recharge their devices).
            </para>

            <para>
                It will be able to play and record HD audio, pictures and
                video, as well as providing the ability to connect into
                computer systems for remote administration, use of SatNav,
                automatic payment systems and the monitoring of other
                devices (including medical) via a personal area network.
                They will generally be automatically hooked into social
                networking systems, tracking a user's movements and
                activities.

            <para>
                A spray can of gel which binds to skin and flesh,
                automatically sealing and cleaning open wounds, as well
                as providing local anaesthetic to dull the pain. A spray
                can contains 3 doses, and takes a round to apply.
