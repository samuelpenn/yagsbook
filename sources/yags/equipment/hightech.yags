                Through a process that began in the 17th century, and began to
                accelerate in the 19th, the 20th century saw a huge increase
                in the rate of technological advancement that made massive
                changes to the way people lived within a single generation.
                The early 20th century saw the first air planes,
                the mechanisation of warfare, the mass production of cars
                and instantaneous long distance communication coming into the
                hands of the masses.

            <para>
                <tm>Yags High Tech</tm> covers the equipment available during
                the period from the early 20th century (Technology Level 6)
                through to the early 21st century (TL 8). Though it is barely
                more than 100 years, there is a huge change in the type of
                items available. However, they are all close enough to the
                present to be considered <e>Modern</e>, and for most people to
                have a vague understanding of what these periods in history
                were like.
            </para>

            <para>
                <tm>High Tech</tm> concerns itself mostly with those things
                that require in-game statistics, such as weapons and vehicles.
                Since vehicles become so predominant during these periods,
                a detailed set of rules on the use of vehicles within
                <tm>Yags</tm> are also included.

                <para>
                    The technology levels in <tm>Yags</tm> are meant as a
                    rough guide as to when an item, skill or knowledge becomes
                    available for use within the game. The date ranges given
                    are based on 'Western Civilisation', and there is always
                    a certain fuzziness around the transition from one period
                    to the next.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Though Europe and North America are currently TL 8, there
                    are still TL 0 (stone age) civilisations in the world, and
                    many smaller countries might still be classed as TL 7, or
                    even TL 6.

                <para>
                    The technology level defines the base level of technology
                    that a culture can support itself, and may be radically
                    different from the technology actually available. There
                    are many African nations where mobile phones are a common
                    means of communicating and where farmers regularly look
                    up grain prices on the internet, but the TL of the culture
                    itself may be 2 or 3. Just because they don't have the
                    knowledge to build a steam engine, doesn't mean they can't
                    make use of (or even know how to repair) high tech equipment
                    purchased from others.

                <para>
                    Where prices are given, they are given for the TL when
                    the item was introduced. Most items will reduce in price
                    at later TLs, though if they become generally unavailable
                    then prices may well increase.
                </para>

                        Covering the period from 1900 to 1945, TL 6 sees the
                        introduction of cars and planes on a scale which
                        affects the lives of everyone.

                    <para>
                        From the point of view of being the setting for a
                        campaign, TL 6 has a number of unique advantages.
                        Firstly, it has just the right amount of technology
                        to allow things to be possible, without it being
                        quite prevalent enough to close down other options.

                        Communication around the world is possible, but
                        possible to prevent on a regular basis without
                        stretching disbelief. Fast air travel exists, but
                        is limited. In America, you have the extremes of
                        high society and abject poverty rubbing shoulders
                        with each other. Two world wars provide plenty of
                        plot hooks, and the '30s provide obvious villains
                        in the form of the Nazis.

                            In a science fiction setting, it is relatively
                            easy for a culture to achieve TL 6 if they are
                            pre-equipped with the right scientific knowledge.
                            As long as skilled craftsman are available, the
                            machines that were common in this period didn't
                            require high levels of automation for production,
                            and could be produced manually.

                            They would rely on trade with more populous worlds to
                            obtain more advanced tools, medicine and machines.

                        Space travel, computers and the wide adoption of
                        television also changed culture considerably.

                        TL 7 provides a number of good possibilities for

                        set around espionage, covert operations and outright
                        shooting wars. The end of the Cold War period
                        actually made it a lot harder to come up with

                        fight. It wasn't long before new enemies were found,
                        and by the early 21st century there is again room for
                        plenty of covert operations, though the nature of such

                        The big issue with TL 8 adventures is that communication

                            a large population, in the order of 100 million people.
                            It requires raw materials, advanced factories, precision
                            machines and the ability to produce sensitive electronic

                            Some technology however is easy to share with low tech
                            neighbours. Mobile phones are ubiquitous almost throughout

                            above TL 0. AK-47s are cheap and easy to use, and have
                            become the staple of tribal warfare. As technology advances
                            though, it becomes harder to support it without the
                            full set of tools. A TL 7 car can be fixed and maintained
                            by someone with a hammer and a bit of knowledge. Fixing the

                    The number of statistics for each weapon can be
                    quite daunting, but they are all there for a reason.
                    The least obvious are the codes listed in the
                    weapon notes. They all have specific meanings which

                    As weapon technology has progressed, so has that for armour.
                    For much of the high tech period however, armour has lagged
                    behind since it has been difficult to make armour effective
                    enough to stop high velocity bullets which is light enough
                    to be wearable on a modern battlefield.

                <para>
                    The first attempts at bulletproof armour where made in the
                    Great War, but weren't particularly successful. Things
                    improved in World War II, but attempts were bulky and

                    With the advent of new materials, body armour has improved
                    greatly since the 2nd half of the
                    20th century though, and a number of different options

                            that it is a sealed suit, with either a filtration

                Here we consider weapons commonly available during TL6,
                which includes both WWI and WWII. WWI saw the development
                of machine guns and trench warfare which invented far
                more effective ways of killing people, and WWII developed
                things about as far as you could go without the use of
                advanced computers and electronics.

                However, it was also the period which saw the invention

                It is also the first period where society starts to become
                recognisably modern. Cars take over from horses, radio
                and telephones become common and the world moves towards

                From 1980 to 2020, TL 8 covers the present day. Huge
                advancements in computer technology become apparent to
                the general population over this period, as communications

                Computer assistance makes its way into vehicles and weapons,
                and remotely operated drones make the battle field safer
                (for those who have the drones). As the threat of full scale
                nuclear war diminishes, so small scale tactical weapons
                are favoured over massive destructive ability.
