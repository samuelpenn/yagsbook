            <title>Modern Equipment</title>

            <para>
                This article lists some of the more common equipment
                available during the <e>Modern</e> period for <tm>Yags</tm>.
                This covers pretty much the 20th and early 21st centuries
                (TL6 - TL8).
            </para>

            <para>
                The list is currently limited to items which require in-game
                statistics, such as weapons and vehicles. Even here, it is
                by no means an exhaustive list, but can be used as a basis
                to derive other items as required.
            </para>

            <para>
                Weapon statistics are summarised at the end in tabular
                form, which is easier to read when choosing what
                equipment a character will be using.

                <title>Weapon Statistics</title>

                <para>
                    The number of statistics for each weapon can be
                    quite daunting, but they are all there for a reason.
                    The least obvious are the codes listed in the
                    weapon notes. They all have specific meanings which
                    are consistent across genres and settings. The main
                    purpose is to give a different feel for different
                    weapons, and to make them useful in different
                    circumstances.

                    <para>
                        The current weapon list goes into far more detail than a
                        simple <e>Big Gun</e>, <e>Small Gun</e> type of listing,
                        but it is only a small selection of what is available in
                        the real world. Much of the complexity of the <tm>Yags</tm>
                        combat system comes from trying to capture the flavour of
                        the different types of weapons.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When selecting a weapon, more than just the damage is
                        important. Size and weight are also a factor, since smaller
                        weapons are better suited in close quarters.

                Tonight: an awful new car from Rover; a brilliant new car from
                Aston Martin; and the Apache helicopter gunship: can it get
                missile lock on a Lotus Exige?
            </quote>

            <para>
                Within <tm>Yags</tm>, vehicles are scaled differently to
                characters. A revolver that does +30 damage may appear
                similar in effectiveness to a heavy machine gun which does
                +30 damage, but the latter is rated as <e>vehicle scale</e>
                and is treated differently.
            </para>

            <para>
                The reason for this is so that large vehicles, artillery
                and starships can stick to using relatively small numbers
                when fighting each other without being underpowered.
            </para>

            <para>
                For the most part, vehicles use the same rules as characters.
                What follows add to the core rules, or replace them where
                necessary.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Vehicle Size</title>

                <para>
                    Whether something counts as a vehicle is based on its
                    construction rather than its size. Generally, something
                    that has been built out of non-living material is
                    classed as a vehicle. It is not based on size - a
                    motorbike is vehicle scale whilst an elephant is still
                    character scale.
                </para>

                <para>
                    All vehicles have a <t>Size</t> statistic, just like
                    characters do. This is on the same scale, so a <t>Size</t> 5
                    motorbike is about the same size as an adult human.
                    A vehicle's <t>Size</t> is roughly proportional to its
                    volume. A <t>Size</t> 5 vehicle is about 1 cubic metre.
                    Every ten fold increase in volume adds +5 to the <t>Size</t>.
                    Some examples of vehicle sizes are below.
                </para>

                <targetlist>

                </targetlist>

                <para>
                    Because of the logarithmic scale, even very large SF
                    starships can be represented in double digit sizes.
                    Since attacks can't damage targets more than 15 size
                    points larger, damage and armour values can also
                    remain relatively low.

                    <para>
                        Just like characters have <e>wounds</e> and <e>stuns</e>,
                        so vehicles keep track of damage in a similar way. All
                        vehicles have a single <e>damage</e> track. This is based
                        on size, but not equal to it:

                    <para>

                    <para>
                        There are 3 damage levels - superficial, moderate and
                        critical. A vehicle that has taken superficial damage
                        is at no penalty to manouevering, a moderately damaged
                        vehicle is at -10 and a critically damaged vehicle is
                        at -25. In addition, a vehicle always has one additional
                        damage level in <e>superficial</e>, and one in a fourth
                        level called <e>disabled</e>, which gives a -40 penalty.
                    </para>

                        <para>
                            As an example, take a modern BMW M3, with a
                            <t>Size</t> of 9. It will have 4 body levels
                            (9 * 9 = 81, divided by 20 = 4), plus the two
                            free levels for a total of 6.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            The first five get split between superficial (2),
                            moderate (2) and critical (1), and the sixth
                            goes into disabled (1).

                        <para>
                            The first two points of damage the car takes will
                            leave it as <e>superficially damaged</e>. On taking
                            its third level it becomes <e>moderately damaged</e>.
                            This is similar to how character scale damage works.
                        </para>
                    </example>

                    <para>
                        There are two types of vehicle damage - <e>major</e>
                        and <e>minor</e>. The former is the default type and
                        is similar to <e>wounds</e> at character scale.
                        <e>Minor</e> damage is like <e>stuns</e> and is non
                        cumulative, but is applied to the same damage track
                        as <e>major</e> damage. Generally, damage from
                        character scale weapons is <e>minor</e> damage.

                        <para>
                            If a vehicle is attacked with a character scale
                            weapon, then the damage roll is halved and the
                            damage caused is <e>Minor</e>. Any vehicle which
                            is 10 or more <t>Size</t> points larger than the
                            weapon (normally vehicles of <t>Size</t> 15+)
                            take no damage from character scale attacks.
                            Also, only <e>wounds</e> are converted to
                            vehicle damage - stuns are ignored.

                            Man portable firearms are generally considered to

                            weapons may be larger. The most effective of these
                            are generally classed as vehicle scale anyway.

                            the damage caused is <e>major</e> damage. If the
                            weapon is 10+ size points larger, then then damage
                            roll is not halved. Outside of fantasy, such
                            events will tend to be limited to elephants trampling
                            a motorcycle.

                        <para>
                            If a vehicle scale weapon is used against characters
                            then the character receives no soak roll unless they
                            are fully protected with heavy armour. In the latter
                            case then their soak roll is merely halved.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Note that a character scale weapon mounted on a
                            vehicle (e.g. a turret mounted light machine gun)
                            is still considered character scale.

                            If the weapon is 10+ <t>Size</t> points larger than
                            the target, then even heavy armour is completely
                            ignored. Characters also suffer the multiplication
                            of damage from oversized vehicle attacks (see below),
                            but normally it's irrelevant by this point.

                        <para>
                            Differences in size between vehicles can be far
                            greater than that between animals (at least, in the
                            real world). In the modern world, the largest vehicles
                            are aircraft carriers of size 40+. SF starships (not
                            covered under <e>High Tech</e>) can be even larger.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Each vehicle mounted weapon has its own <t>Size</t>
                            which is independant of the vehicle it is mounted on.
                            Most anti-vehicle weapons (such as the main gun on
                            a tank) are <t>Size</t> 10. Secondary weapons (such
                            as a heavy machine gun) will be <t>Size</t> 5.
                            Heavier artillery or naval guns may be <t>Size</t>
                            15, 20 or larger.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            For vehicle on vehicle action, if the target vehicle is
                            10+ <t>Size</t> larger than the attacking weapon then
                            any damage caused is <e>Minor</e>. If the target is
                            15+ <t>Size</t> larger, then no damage is caused.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            If the attack is 10+ larger, then any damage levels
                            caused are doubled and any armour is halved. Each
                            further +10 <t>Size</t> increase adds a further
                            multiple to the damage caused.

                <title>General Statistics</title>

                <para>
                    Size isn't the only statistic vehicles have in <tm>Yags</tm>.
                    As for characters, <t>Strength</t>, <t>Health</t>,
                    <t>Agility</t> and <t>Perception</t> also exist for vehicles.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <t>Strength</t> is pretty straightforward, and is a measure
                    of the vehicle's pulling power. It can be compared directly
                    against the strength of a person.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <t>Health</t> is a measure of the general reliability and
                    toughness of the vehicle. A <t>Health</t> of 3 is pretty
                    standard. A fragile F1 car or broken old banger may have
                    a <t>Health</t> of 2, more rugged off-road cars or military
                    vehicles will have higher <t>Health</t>.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <t>Agility</t> represents how agile the vehicle is.
                    Generally though. it isn't used directly since vehicles
                    rarely drive themselves. Instead, it caps the
                    <t>Dexterity</t> of the driver (rider/pilot). It doesn't
                    affect the speed of the vehicle, but may affect how well
                    it handles at high speeds.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <t>Perception</t> is only used if the vehicle has its own
                    sensor systems. For most vehicles in the High Tech era
                    sensors are limited to the Mk I eyeball, so this is zero.

                    <title>Speed and other things</title>

                    <para>
                        Vehicles will generally have a <e>speed</e>, which is
                        the top speed in km/h. They also have an <e>acceleration</e>,
                        which is in km/h/s. What this means is that a motorbike
                        with an acceleration of 20 km/h/s will, from a standing
                        start, be doing 20 km/h after 1 second. After 5 seconds
                        (a round) it will be doing 100km/h. In reality acceleration
                        slows as a vehicle approaches its top speed, but this is
                        ignored for simplicity.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If you really want to, halve acceleration if the car is
                        travelling at greater at half it's top speed.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Each vehicle also has a <e>range</e>, which is how many
                        kilometres it can travel on a single load of fuel. Again,
                        this is just an average for simplicity.

                of machine guns and trench warfare which invented far
                more effective ways of killing people, and WWII developed
                things about as far as you could go without the use of
                advanced computers and electronics.

                    This is the end of TL 6, and saw the development

                    for TL 7. The late war years are pretty much on
                    the cusp of TL 6/TL 7, but are considered to be
                    late TL 6 rather than early TL 7.

                World War II had spured the development of new technologies
                that became the defining achievements of TL7. Computers,
                electronics, nuclear power and space flight all become
                achievable and even in common everyday use, bringing about
                some of the greatest changes in technology never before
                witnessed.

            <para>
                With the advent of the Cold War, both Russia and America had
