            <title>Modern Equipment</title>

            <para>
                This article lists some of the more common equipment
                available during the <e>Modern</e> period for <tm>Yags</tm>.
                This covers pretty much the 20th and early 21st centuries
                (TL6 - TL8).
            </para>

            <para>
                The list is currently limited to items which require in-game
                statistics, such as weapons and vehicles. Even here, it is
                by no means an exhaustive list, but can be used as a basis
                to derive other items as required.
            </para>

            <para>
                Weapon statistics are summarised at the end in tabular
                form, which is easier to read when choosing what
                equipment a character will be using.
            </para>

                <title>Weapon Statistics</title>

                <para>
                    The number of statistics for each weapon can be
                    quite daunting, but they are all there for a reason.
                    The least obvious are the codes listed in the
                    weapon notes. They all have specific meanings which
                    are consistent across genres and settings. The main
                    purpose is to give a different feel for different
                    weapons, and to make them useful in different
                    circumstances.
                </para>

                            shots or burst fire. Unless specified, an automatic
                            burst consist of 10 rounds. If a number is specified,
                            then the burst has this many rounds.

                    <para>
                        The current weapon list goes into far more detail than a
                        simple <e>Big Gun</e>, <e>Small Gun</e> type of listing,
                        but it is only a small selection of what is available in
                        the real world. Much of the complexity of the <tm>Yags</tm>
                        combat system comes from trying to capture the flavour of
                        the different types of weapons.

                    <para>
                        When selecting a weapon, more than just the damage is
                        important. Size and weight are also a factor, since smaller
                        weapons are better suited in close quarters.

            <para>
                Here we consider weapons commonly available during TL6,
                which includes both WWI and WWII. WWI saw the development
                of machine guns and trench warfare which invented far
                more effective ways of killing people, and WWII developed
                things about as far as you could go without the use of
                advanced computers and electronics.

                    This is the end of TL 6, and saw the development
                    of many technologies that would become the basis
                    for TL 7. The late war years are pretty much on
                    the cusp of TL 6/TL 7, but are considered to be
                    late TL 6 rather than early TL 7.

                World War II had spured the development of new technologies
                that became the defining achievements of TL7. Computers,
                electronics, nuclear power and space flight all become
                achievable and even in common everyday use, bringing about
                some of the greatest changes in technology never before
                witnessed.

            <para>
                With the advent of the Cold War, both Russia and America had
                the opportunity to engage in an arms race and indirect conflict
                which caused no end of suffering, but which provides plenty
                of opportunity for gaming.
