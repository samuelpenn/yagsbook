            <title>The Middle Ages</title>

            <para>
                The period from the collapse of the Roman Empire to the
                start of the Renaissance is probably the most popular as
                far as fantasy campaign settings go. They are often based
                on something similar to Medieval Europe, taking ideas from
                a thousand years of history.
            </para>

            <para>
                <tm>Yags Medieval</tm> aims to cover this period of history,
                detailing the weapons and equipment available during this
                time, and taking a look at the possible genres and settings
                that can make use of these eras.
            </para>

            <para>
                Unlike <s>High Tech</s>, which covers very definite technology
                levels (TL 6 through to TL 8), <tm>Medieval</tm> is somewhat
                more complicated. Technologically, it covers from TL 2 to TL 3.
                Though TL 2 is the <e>Iron Age</e>, this
                ended before the rise of the Roman Empire. Since <tm>Medieval</tm>
                covers the period <e>after</e> Rome fell, what gives?
            </para>

            <para>
                The collapse of Rome saw a loss of technology and
                infrastructure. Writing (at least, on any large scale) pretty much
                disappeared in Western Europe during this time. The ability to
                build large stone structures was lost. The lack of trade
                reduced the types of raw materials available, again limiting
                what was possible. Civilisation fell back to how it was before
                the rise of Greece and Rome.
            </para>

            <para>
                As far as equipment availability goes, this period is considered
                similar to time of the Iron Age, around the time of the Etruscan
                and early Roman cultures. Rome itself is assumed to have
                achieved TL 3 at some point (at least in some respects), and
                the Medieval period sees Europe climbing back to this level of
                technology, and beyond.
            </para>

                <title>TL 2 - The Dark Ages</title>

                <para>
                    The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 marked the
                    beginning of the <e>Dark Ages</e> for Europe. With the
                    collapse of trade and the retreat of the Roman armies,
                    towns and cities become both vulnerable and also
                    redundant. With no trade, it was difficult to support
                    large population centres. Taxes stopped being paid,
                    and the roads and legions could no longer be maintained.
                </para>

                <para>
                    From the perspective of gaming, the darkness that
                    descended on Europe can be viewed as a boon. With the
                    lack of trade routes, foreign countries regain their
                    mysteriousness and travel becomes dangerous and
                    exciting.
                </para>

                <para>
                    This is also the likely period of the mythical
                    King Arthur, though not the chivalrous version of
                    <e>Le Morte d'Arthur</e> which belongs to a much
                    later time period, but a darker, grittier version
                    set in the aftermath of Rome's fall.
                </para>

                <para>
                    This period ends around the start of the first
                    millennium, at a time when the biggest threat to
                    most of Europe are the Vikings. At this point there
                    are lots of opportunities for adventure, and though
                    the Vikings were viewed as raiders, they were also
                    traders, farmers and bards. It is a perfect period
                    for a <e>Mythical</e> Europe, where strange beasts
                    dwell at the fringes of civilisation.

                <title>TL 3 - Feudalism</title>

                <para>
                    This period saw a cultural as well as technological
                    shift. Rather than tribes, Europe is beginning to
                    organise itself into countries. Feudalism is the big
                    change that allows cultures to stabilise and trade
                    to start to flourish once again.
                </para>

                <para>
                    This period is dominated on the battlefield by
                    Knights, with armour improving greatly from the 11th
                    to the 15th century.

                <para>
                    A large proportion of fantasy campaigns are probably
                    set in a fantastic generic version of the Medieval
                    period, so a lot of what can be found here is applicable
                    to a fantasy game.

                <title>Crafting</title>

                <para>
                    Everything during this period is hand made. Smiths and
                    other craftsman can be found in most villages, though
                    their skills and experience can vary widely. It is
                    very possible that characters will want to forge their
                    own items (normally weapons and armour), or at least
                    be interested in obtaining a 'special' item of highest
                    quality.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Anybody with the <e>Smithing</e> skill can make metal
                    weapons and armour. Having the <e>Armourer</e> or
                    <e>Weaponsmith</e> technique will halve the normal
                    difficulty. Though many metal weapons have wooden or
                    leather components, their construction is simple
                    enough that they are covered by the main skill.
                </para>

                    <item name="Smithing">

                        wooden weapons.

                        as the domain of women.

                <para>
                    Some items (those deemed interesting to characters) will
                    have their difficulty detailed in the equipment lists.
                    The required skill (together with the most relevant
                    technique) will be listed, along with the difficulty and
                    the time required.
                </para>

                <para>
                    When making an item, each attempt takes the amount of
                    time listed. It is considered a long task, so a number
                    of successes are required before the task is completed.
                    Subsequent attempts add successes together until
                    finished. Multiple items may be made at once if enough
                    successes are obtained in a single roll.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If you fail any attempt, then no progress is made, but
                    there is no ill effect. Each subsequent failure though
                    reduces the quality of the item by 2 points (see making
                    inferior items below).
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Improved Items</title>

                    <para>
                        It is possible to make high quality items which are
                        better than average. Doing so raises the difficulty,
                        and the decision to make a quality item must be made
                        before any work begins. You can only make a quality
                        item if you have the technique for making items of
                        that type.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For weapons, any of <e>damage</e>, <e>attack</e> and
                        <e>defence</e> can be improved. For armour, it is
                        possible to improve its <e>soak</e>.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A statistic can be improved by at most 1 point for each
                        full 5 points. So a broad sword that does +12 damage
                        can have its damage improved by 2 points above the base
                        (to +14). Any number of statistics can be improved, the
                        limit applies to each one individually.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Each point of improvement raises the difficulty by 10,
                        and each statistic you are improving adds one to the
                        number of successes required. The difficulty modifier
                        is applied after halving the base difficulty for having
                        the right technique.
                    </para>

                    <example title="Making a better sword">
                        <para>
                            A broadsword is difficulty 40 and requires 4 successes
                            to make. A standard broadsword has a damage of +12,
                            attack of +5 and a defence of +5.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            A skilled smith decides to make a quality version. He
                            could raise the damage by +2, and/or both the attack and
                            defence by +1.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Since he has the <e>Weaponsmith</e> technique, the
                            base difficulty to make a normal sword is halved to 20.
                            Raising the damage to +14 (two point bonus) would add
                            +20 to the difficulty, bringing it to 40, and increasing
                            the required successes to 5 (one statistic improved).
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            If he was skilled enough, then he could also raise both
                            attack and damage by +1 each. This adds another +20 to
                            the difficulty, bringing it to 60, and increases the
                            required successes to 7 (+1 for each of the two statistics).
                        </para>

                    <para>
                        If any craft attempt fails during the process, then the
                        item will be a standard item with no special bonuses.

                    <title>Making Inferior Items</title>

                    <para>
                        If you're in a hurry, or just not very good, you can
                        opt to make an inferior item. This doesn't require any
                        special techniques. The difficulty (after halving, if
                        you do have the technique) is dropped by 10, but the
                        quality of the item is dropped by 2 points. Two random
                        statistics are each dropped by 1 point (for armour, the
                        soak is dropped by 2 points).
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If this brings any statistic to less than zero, then the
                        item is useless. If someone does try to use it, it breaks
                        on a roll of 1-5 (attack, defence, damage or soak roll).

                <para>
                    Throughout the medieval period, monasteries were the
                    centres of learning in Western Europe. Books were
                    laboriously copied by hand by highly skilled monks
                    who spent months artfully illuminating the text within.

                <para>
                    For some campaigns set in this period, books can be a
                    vital part of the game, especially if it includes a
                    more mythical version of Europe with the focus on
                    learning magical arts.

                <quote signature="Icelandic proverb">
                    Cattle die, kinsmen die, so shall you die too. But one thing
                    I know that never dies: the fame of a dead man's deeds.
                </quote>

                <para>
                    One feature of many sagas from this period is that they
                    don't focus on a single character, but on a family across
                    many generations. A heroic warrior eventually settles
                    down and has sons, who then go off to perform heroic deeds
                    of their own.

                    is one that ensures advancement takes place over years of
                    game time. A feature of many fantasy RPGs is that characters
                    may begin at age 16 as inexperienced newbies, but have reached
                    epic levels of ability before their 17th birthday.

                        Firstly, it is important that adventures don't happen too
                        often. There should be no more than one or two major
                        adventures over the course of a year. Characters will have
                        a lot of down time, which may be spent either at home,
                        or working as mercenaries for a lord.

                    <para>
                        Generally, most activities will happen in the Autumn, after
                        the harvest has been collected but before the Winter sets
                        in. It is during this time that wars will be fought and
                        blood feuds settled.

                    <title>Experience</title>

                    <para>
                        The assumption of such a campaign is that it is about
                        the character's rise to heroism. Most characters will
                        start as <e>Mundane</e> and work their way up from
                        there.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Experience will come from three possible sources -
                        exposure, heroism and training.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If a character is exposed to a task which they aren't
                        skilled in, then they can gain experience in a suitable
                        skill. Use the rules for <e>Realistic Experience</e>
                        in the standard <s>Character</s> rules for this.

                            At the end of each year, each character gains one
                            point to put towards advancing a single attribute.

                        Eventually, everybody grows old and dies. Heroes like to
                        die in battle (or at least, they claim they do), but
                        those that survive enough battles get to make ageing
                        checks.

                Most of European civilisation at this time was made up
                of small villages with a few larger market towns. Most
                of the population had reverted to being rural, and most
                social structures were tribal.

                <title>The Economy</title>

                <para>
                    For much of the Dark Ages most trade was done by barter.
                    Few Kings were powerful enough to be able to enforce their
                    currency beyond their borders, and even within their borders
                    coins devalued over time, as they were gradually shaved by
                    unscrupulous merchants.

                <para>
                    In England, the most common coinage was silver, based on the
                    Troy pound (373g of silver), which was split into 240 pennies (d).
                    There was also the concept of a shilling, which was about 5 pennies
                    (though this could vary). In modern money, 1d would be equivalent
                    to about £20.

                    War is common, but limited. For much of the <e>Dark Ages</e>
                    most armies would consist of a few dozen people, raiding their
                    neighbours for goods and slaves. Most battles can be viewed
                    as skirmishes, with warriors seeking out individual fights
                    rather than organising into tight formations.
