            <para>
                Designed to fire the BGM-71 TOW wire guided missile,
                the M151 is a vehicle mounted launcher which is also
                (barely) man portable. The TOW (Tube-launched,
                Optically Tracked, Wire command) is a guided missile that
                must be manually guided by an operator at the
                launch platform. It was first produced in 1970 by the
                US Army. The BGM-71 is the missile itself, and it may
                be fired from a variety of launch platforms.
