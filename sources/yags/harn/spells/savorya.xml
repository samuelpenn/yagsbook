            Savorya is the magic of mind and spirit, perhaps the most
            esoteric of the convocations of the Shek-Pvar.
        </para>

        <para>
            Savoryans deal with aura and knowledge, with principles
            which, they at least believe, stand above the other elements,
            and of the Shek-Pvar. A Savoryan's is, probably, the greatest
            knowledge of psionics, and perhaps of Kelestia itself.
        </para>

        <para>
            It is not possible to read a person's deep thoughts with
            Savorya. The aura of a person - which gives religious, moral
            and elemental connections - may be read, as can emotions.
            The latter can give clues to a person's surface thoughts,
            but spells to delve deeper than this are unknown.
        </para>

        <para>
            When a person's aura is read, a roll is made (determined by
            the spell) and the following chart should be used to find
            what information was revealed.

                    Elemental and divine affinities, if any. Shek-Pvar who
                    are attuned to an element will have an aura tainted by
                    that element. Priests of a god are also bound to their
                    god, and this affects their aura.

        <para>
            Savorya elementals are spirits, generally appearing as a white,
            faintly glowing mist. They have minimal affect on the physical
            world, feeling like a soft breeze at most. They are unable to
            pass through physical objects.
        </para>

        <para>
            They may engage in a sort of
            mental assualt, causing fatigue in the target. In this case,
            they cause damage with their will, against the will of the
            target, causing fatigue levels in the same way that a physical
            attack causes wound or stun levels.
        </para>

        <para>
            Savorya elmentals can perceive the physical world, regardless
            of the level of illumination. They see emotions in the same
            ense that magic (Neutral) elementals see auras. Their emotion
            sense is d20 + rank * 5. They can also tell, to some extent,
            the strength of a creature's mind.

            <para>
                This spell must be enchanted into two or more artifacts,
                normally glass or crystal balls, a gem or a mirror. As long
                as the artifacts remain within range of each other, whatever
                light falls on one will be displayed on the surface of the
                others, allowing them to be used as scrying devices (though
                the image shown is reversed).
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The basic spell allows the artifact to display a poor
                quality, out of focus, image. Anything within a metre or
                so of the artifact can be seen. A boosted version of
                the spell allows sound to be transmitted, and also
                improves the focus of the image, allowing things to be
                seen clearly out to a greater range.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The artifacts must be within some range of each other in
                order to be able to transmit. The range of the artifact
                is equal to 1km at rank I, and increases by a factor of
                five each rank thereafter (5km, 125km, 625km etc). A
                rank VII artifact covers the entire world.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The above assumes that two artifacts are being created,
                in which case both communicate with each other.
                Communication is continuous, and cannot be switched off,
                so they are sometimes left covered when not in use. The
                <e>network</e> can be increased by creating three or more
                artifacts at the same time. Each artifact beyond the
                second reduces the effective rank of the spell by one
                (for purposes of range, dispelling etc).
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The seeing eye will only communicate with one other at
                a time. To switch, the artifact must be touched and the
                name of the desired destination spoken. The artifacts
                are named at time of creation.

                This spell allows the caster to ask a simple yes/no

                nearby. The caster can only use this spell, or one similar
                to it, once a week. It takes d20*5 minutes before an answer
                is returned. Higher castings of this spell provides an
                answer to a specific keyword or subject. This gives less

                An enchantment which can be placed on a written work, or other

                understanding. The caster is not immune to the effect.
                Whenever someone tries to read the work, they get a will roll
                opposed to the caster's own will. The caster does not have to
                stay near the work once the spell is cast, but she does have to
                concentrate on the spell. Glamour can rarely adjust more than
                ten percent of the intrinsic meaning.

                The target of this spell perceives an illusion, centred
                on the Shek-Pvar. The caster becomes bathed in light,
                surrounded by a soft aura. The effect depends very much
                on the viewer, but may instill fear in those who dislike
                light, and could give a favourable response from those
                who follow the gods of light.

                The task must be simple in nature (e.g. deliver a message,
                kill a person, guard me), and must be verbally described to
                the target. For the base spell, the target must agree to the
                task willingly - this spell is useful only for ensuring that
                they don't go back on their word. A grudging agreement is
                where the target would normally refuse, though out of belief
                that they are being under paid, rather than due to moral
                or practical objections. Unwilling agreements are ones the
                target would never agree to, but which don't go against the
                target's core principles, or involve serious danger. A forced
                agreement is one which is dangerous (though not suicidal), or
                forces the target to, say, betray a close friend.

                A spell which allows the caster to read documents written in a

                caster must know either the language or the script.
                The spell creates a special relationship between the caster
                and a single page of the written work; and cannot be extended
                to include other texts or readers. The caster is perceiving
                the imprinted thoughts of the author, and this gets harder
                with the age of the document. She must make a perception roll
                of 15+ if the document is less than a month old, 20+ for up
                to a year, and at a further +5 for each tenfold increase in
                age of the work. If it was written by someone who didn't
                understand what they were writing, translation may be impossible.
                The caster cannot speak or write while performing the spell,
                so any translations will have to be from memory.

                they fail their ego roll. The victim suffers seven stuns,
                automatically loosing their next attack and dropping
                anything held.

                This spell is laid upon the caster, causing him to be ignored by
                those within range who fail their resistance roll. As long as the
                caster keeps a low profile, he will be ignored. If he does something
                which attracts attention, observers get another roll. Note that those
                outside the range of the spell are unaffected, so can possibly act
                to warn those nearby. More powerful castings of this spell may
                allow the caster to interact with others, causing them to treat the
                caster as another guard for instance.

                When cast on a target, Knife of Kasrith will sever the spirit and
                mind of the target. The target is not killed, but they no longer have
                conscious control over their body. Any automatic body functions will
                continue to function, such as breathing, and they can taste, see and
                hear normally. However, they cannot move, speak or cast spells.

            <para>
                This spell is cast upon the caster, and while it remains in effect,
                the caster can affect the mind of those he speaks to, forcing them
                to consider anything he says to be reasonable. When a conversation
                is first started with someone, then they get a will roll to resist.
                If the target's will is overcome, then guards will open doors for
                the caster, merchants will willingly hand over goods as gifts and
                so on. If suggestions are unreasonable (kill your lord, sign over
                all your property to my name), then further will checks, at a possible
                bonus, will be allowed.

                This spell (which is not, actually, a ward) is used to protect
                a secret from being discovered through magical means. It can not
                prevent discovery using mundane methods. The rank of the spell is
                modified by how many people know the secret. If the number of people
                who know changes after the spell is cast, then the rank of the spell
                is changed to reflect this.

                If 128 or more people know of the secret, then the spell is broken,
                and the caster is made aware of this fact. Likewise, if the effective
                rank of the ward drops to zero or less, then the spell is broken. The
                secret cannot be discovered by arcane means until the spell is removed,
                either with Survan's Key, or a Dispel at least two ranks higher. The
                latter must be cast on someone who knows the secret, and specifically
                against this spell.

                the Ward is broken, and the caster can then divine the secret. The
                caster of the original Mikaad's Ward will know that their spell

                When this spell is cast, the caster becomes capable of
                perceiving heat. The sense replaces the caster's normal
                sight. Hot things are bright, cold things are dark. Living
                creatures can be seen reasonably easily, though may be
                hidden by cold clothing. Walls and doors can be seen unless
                the environment has had a very stable temperature, since
                they will tend to heat up at different rates.
