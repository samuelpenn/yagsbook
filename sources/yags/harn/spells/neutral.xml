            The Neutral convocation affects energy and magic directly.
            It rarely has any physical effect, though is good for
            defending against other magics.
        </para>

        <para>
            Neutral elementals are raw magic, random and wild. They
            appear as a whirling cloud of bright motes. They cannot
            pass through physical objects, but can slip through a gap
            of almost any size.
        </para>

        <para>
            The elemental's perception of the world is one based on
            aura's. Objects without an aura cannot be truly perceived,
            except as a featureless flatness. Living creatures, especially
            sapiants, can be clearly seen, and recognised by their aura.
            The aura sense of a magic elemental is equal to 5 x rank,
            though they can always tell the elemental affinity of a
            creature, including Shek-Pvar.
        </para>

        <para>
            A magical elemental may strike at the lifeforce of a target,
            causing fatigue and confusion.

                Abort disrupts another spell while it is being cast. The target
                spell caster is touched, and if the spell being cast is of equal
                or lower rank than the Abort, then the spell may be aborted,
                assuming the target spellcaster fails an opposed will check. The
                abort must be cast before the target spell is finished.

                <e>Attune</e> between another Shek-Pvar and the item,

                Chain links together multiple other spells, deferring fatigue
                until after all the spells have been cast. No spell in the
                chain can be higher rank than the Chain itself, and at most,
                1 spell per rank of Chain (not including Chain itself) can
                be chained together.

                All the spells to be cast are declared,
                together with their order, targets etc, and chain is cast.
                If successful, the other spells are each cast. Once the final
                spell is cast, fatigue for all spells (including the chain) is
                then gained. No spell in the chain can have a casting time
                longer than a round, and all must be cast within a round of
                each other.

                entering. Permanent enchantments are suspended by the
                spell. The caster cannot cast spells of lower rank herself
                while this spell is up. Also, she cannot move. If she
                moves, the bubble collapses. The bubble has a basic radius
                of 3m.

                Stores the next spell cast into a minor artifact which has
                been opened for enchantment. The spell to be stored must be
                cast on the following round, and must be of at most the
                rank of the Store. Only the basic spell is stored - any

                Spells placed into an artifact in this way are layered,

                artifacts nearly always store only one type of spell,
                though this is not necessary. However, all stored spells
                must be of the same convocation as the item.

                Closes an opened minor artifact. At this point the trigger
                event for the artifact is also declared. The basic spell
                allows command phrases to activate the artifact. The
                artifact must be held in the hand, and the command word
                spoken aloud in a firm voice.
            </para>

            <para>
                Boosting the spell enables a worn item to be used with a
                command phrase without having to grasp it in a hand. For
                example, a brooch or cloak could be enchanted in this way.
            </para>

            <para>
                An artifact can also be activated with a gesture which
                involves the artifact. A ring could involve a hand
                gesture, a brooch would need to be wielded.
            </para>

            <para>
                Finally, a mental command can be used. This requires that
                the item is within 3m of the user, and a particular mental
                command actively thought. The user must <em>attune</em> to
                the item in order to be able to use it in this way. An
                item which 'fires' some form of bolt type spell, must still
                be pointed in order to target effectively. Such items
                might as well stick with a gesture trigger effect.

                This spell disrupts all magic in the area. Spells which

                Major artifacts are unaffected, though if they are

                roll as well to keep them maintained. Minor artifacts can
                be destroyed with this spell. If the Close that was
                used is of a equal or lower rank, then all spells in the
                minor artifact are lost. If the Focus is of equal or lower
                rank, then the artifact is rendered non-magical (and hence
                any spells in it are lost, regardless of the Close).
