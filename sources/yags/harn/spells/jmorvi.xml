        <para>
            Jmorvi Shek-Pvar, standing between fire and earth, have an affinity for
            all minerals, but especially metals. Their element is the solid heart of
            the world, steel and black iron.
        </para>

        <para>
            Most Jmorvi are artificers; their magic tends to run in a slower vein
            than that of other Shek-Pvar. The element and its manipulators are powerful
            and unyielding, but sometimes brittle, insensitive, brutal and shallow.
            Jmorvi distrust the spiritual believing the soul of humanity to be
            unpredictable and unreliable. They prefer the sureness and solidity of
            cold, hard steel.
        </para>

        <para>
            Several Jmorvi spells can be used to enhance the toughness of
            materials. Enhancing fully metallic items is easier than
            enhancing partially metallic or other items. If it is used to
            enchant armour, then the basic bonus given to the soak of the
            item is the soak to use if the armour itself is harmed. The
            soak bonus gained by the wearer of the armour depends on the
            type of armour being enhanced.

        </targetlist>

        <para>
            For example, a +30 bonus to a chain hauberk would only give a
            +12 bonus to the wearer's soak. The same bonus to a metal helm
            would only give +1.

            <para>
                A spell to detect and identify metallic minerals. The
                caster declares a specific metallic mineral and learns
                the direction to the nearest (single) 'good source'.
                A small amount of refined metal in close proximity is
                more noticeable than a large deposit of ore a hundred
                metres away. Although the spell ignores any Focus
                through which it is cast, it may detect a companion's
                sword.

                This ward protects a wholly metallic object of up to size 3
                from harm. It grants a +15 to soak the next time significant
                damage (i.e. a soak roll is required) is suffered. The ward
                then terminates. If it is placed on armour, it only grants
                one third the protection to the wearer. This ward cannot be
                stacked with other wards.

            <para>
                An enchantment which transforms the surface of a wholly metallic
                object into another metal. The enchantment is fragile, and, because
                it only places an extremely thin veneer, transformed objects will
                not pass more than a cursory inspection. Scratching the object,
                even with a fingernail, removes some of the plating. The
                transformation must be to a lower density metal. The maximum weight
                of the object is 100kg.

                or damage) is increased by 1.  This is not cumulative with any
