            Fyvrianism is the magic of the earth, of green and growing,
            of pale and dying things, of the cycles of growth and decay
            that underlie the natural world. The base of Fyvria is
            fertile earth, where life swarms in its endless
            struggle to survive and prosper.

            <para>
                Regenesis greatly accelerates the healing of living things. While
                the spell is being maintained, the target creature will get a
                natural healing roll every eight hours. The Shek-Pvar must keep the
                spell up over at least an eight hour period while her target
                rests or sleeps. The process is fatiguing however, five fatigue
                levels are gained by the target during the period, reduced by
                one per point of stamina. Versions of this spell which regenerate
                limbs do so very slowly. Even a lost hand will take about 15 days.
                Dead matter, even if it can be regenerated, can never be restored
                to life.

            <para>
                This spells causes very rapid growth in succulent vines. All plants
                within range begin growing to form a clump of tough, tangled vines,
                branches and roots. After three rounds, when the plants have reached
                about ten times normal size, they will die. The plants will have
                rotted back within about half an hour. Though the Shek-Pvar is at
                the centre of the area when it begins to grow, he generally does
                have time to get clear if he so wishes. Anyone caught in the vines
                needs to make a strength roll of 30+ each round to try and escape.
                Even success means they move only 1m.

                This spell regrows a complete organism from a part of it. For the
                basic spell, 50% of the organism must be present in order to regrow
                the whole. It can be used to regrow lost body parts, restore corpses
                or recover a plant. Dead organisms are not restored to life.

                When cast upon a living plant or creature, the Shek-Pvar will be
                alerted if the target perceives another living creature. It is
                generally used as a alarm. The Shek'Pvar must be within medium
                range of the target if she is to hear the alarm. The perceptive
                range of most plants is about three metres. The warning is via
                a mind link to the Shek-Pvar.

                This spell will heal either disease or injury in a living creature.
                If used to heal a disease, then the disease is completely healed, and
                the creature gains from one to five points of long term fatigue,
                depending on the severity of the disease. If used to heal injuries,
                then up to six body levels are immediately healed, and converted to
                long term fatigue. If the target cannot gain more fatigue, then there
                is no effect. It cannot be used to regenerate lost body parts.

                This spell enables the caster to melt through earth, stone or wood,

                one quarter walking speed, through wood at a fifth speed, and through
                stone at one tenth speed. If the caster is inside a solid object
                when the spell stops, then she is instantly killed. Clothes and
                equipment are unaffected, so only her naked body can travel this way.

                This spell grows an adult body from a dead embryo or foetus, though
                it only works on mammals. The foetus must have been dead at least
                six hours, and no more than 24 hours when the spell is begun. It
                takes about ten hours of casting initially to start the spell, and
                the foetus must be kept in clean water and finely sifted earth. Each
                day, the growing body consumes about 200 litres of water and 100kg
                of earth, and the caster must spend about 4 hours with the body.
                After 56 days, the body is a fully grown adult, and is ready to
                receive a spirit. It will die within a few hours if a spirit does
                not inhabit it.

                immortal species. The caster will stop aging for 1 year. However,
