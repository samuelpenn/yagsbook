            Lyahvi is the magic of the air, of the insubstantial, the invisible,
            the ethereal, and the illusory. Lyahvian magi are manipulators of
            light: reflection, refraction and confusion, with effects faster than the
            eye and difficult to describe.

        <para>
            They are masters of air and other gases, of sound (which travels on the air),
            and they can summon Asiri and other ethereals to their benefit. The
            Lyahvi nemesis is earth, represented by the convocation of Fyvria. The
            essence of Lyahvi is bright, sterile and unliving. Secondary: Peleahn,
            Savorya. Tertiary: Jmorvi, Odivshe. Diametric: Fyvria.

                The spell is placed upon an object, which may be the caster, another
                creature or an inanimate object. All sound near that point is muffled, and
                perception tasks are at +5 difficulty to hear sounds from the target. The
                spell effects anything within a metre radius of the target point.

                Summons a sapient element of Lyahvi, which appears as a small mote of
                light, about as bright as a candle flame. The elemental has limited
                intelligence, but can follow simple instructions. It cannot pass through
                solid matter, but can travel as much as 25m away from the caster. If it is
                commanded to travel further than this, then control over it will be lost. It
                can see and hear, though cannot understand any speech other than its
                elemental language, and will have difficulty telling mundane creatures
                apart. All communication with the elemental is speech, in the tongue of the
                lyahvian element. Opposed Will rolls must be made when the sprite is
                summoned in order to control it. The sprite will have a will of one.

                This spell creates an illusory image of a ghostly, humanoid
                apparition. It cannot be made to look like a particular person,
                and it is perfectly stationary. It is obviously 'not real',
                being mostly transparent. It is an awareness difficulty of 10
                to notice it as an illusion. The animated version of the illusion
                is merely a repetitive animation - it is set when the spell is
                cast and cannot be changed.

            <para>
                The target of the spell is made translucent and semi-ethereal, though
                this only affects sentient creatures, so no clothing or equipment will be
                affected along with them. The target has difficulty moving. Normal air
                resists as if they were swimming in molasses, and maximum movement is agility
                metres per round. Solid objects, such as walls, can be moved through at about
                a tenth this speed. The target cannot be easily harmed - sword slashes etc
                will be felt as a stinging pain, but actual damage will only be done on a
                natural roll of 20. Affected targets cannot be larger than the wizard.

            <para>
                This spell creates powerful, vivid and invisible (subliminal) illusions.
                This is an extremely subtle spell used to help the caster in a conversation.
                The spell may be cast immediately prior to, or in the course of a
                conversation. Thereafter, while it is maintained, the caster can give the
                target brief illusion-flashes which tend to act directly on the subconscious.
                If properly used the subliminal effect can be profound. An experienced
                caster can convince almost anyone of anything. But in the hands of a novice,
                it is generally ineffective. It used to enhance the caster's guile, charm
                or trade skill, it adds +15 if a plausible argument is made.

            <para>
                A spell to find/summon ethereals. It will find the nearest ethereal
                entity, and the caster will have a general idea of its nature and
                strength. A contest of wills can be made to summon a found ethereal,
                and success means it is under the caster's control for the duration.
                If the caster can summon multiple ethereals, then there is a -1
                penalty to will for trying to control each ethereal beyond the first.

            <para>
                A spell which allows the caster to increase or decrease the windforce
                in his immediate vicinity. The effect is local, so while it could be
                used to drive a single ship the caster is on, and it cannot be used
                to drive an entire fleet. Wind can be increased from still air to a
                gale force wind. It works best outside, where there is plenty of air
                available. Effects indoors are unpredictable.

            <para>
                Renders the caster translucent and ethereal. In this form he is
                immune to physical damage, but remains susceptible to enchantment.
                With the basic spell, the caster cannot achieve full etherealness.
                He can still feel events in the material world, but cannot affect
                them. He is not immune to physical harm, but injuries are always
                fatigue rather than body levels. Clothes and items carried can
                be affected by the spell, at the caster's option.
                If the caster can create a link item, then this is designated on
                casting and must be being touched. It remains physical, but can
                be affected by the caster. If it is taken from him, it can be
                used to harm him.

                An enchantment to protect an object or person against harm by
                dematerialising it. The object evaporates within a round, and
                recombines between a day and a week later, at a point designated
                at the time of casting. Time of recombination is random, and the
                place must have been visited by the caster previously. Accuracy
                drops greatly with distance, though it is generally 'safe'.
                While dematerialised, the subject has no consciousness, and all
                enchantments on them are dropped.
