        <para>
            Odivshe is the magic of slow, cool darkness, of water and ice, the opposite
            of fire and action. Odivshe magi study and work their spells on water and
            shadow, ice and cold. They are sometimes called the wizards of gloom.
        </para>

        <para>
            As well as these mundane elements, the Odivshe sometimes manipulate ethereal
            water. This "substance" takes a variety of forms, generally similar to
            ordinary water, but thinner, sometimes invisible. Often it is described as an
            "icy pallor that robs away the breath and drowns the very spirit with its
            dark, clinging, gloom". It takes about twice as long to drown in ethereal
            water, although this may be small comfort to those who have the experience.
            In general, ethereal water is easier to walk/run through than mundane water
            (half air movement rates), and more difficult to swim in (double fatigue).
        </para>

        <para>
            The Odivshe use it because it is easier to manipulate than mundane water.
            Ethereal water effects ethereal creatures as mundane water affects mundane
            creatures. It will also quench ethereal fire.

                A spell to gently reduce the temperature of an object. It works best on
                objects containing high proportions of water, and can cause minor discomfort
                to organic creatures. It is a good treatment for sunstroke, and can deaden
                pain. It causes one level of fatigue, and reduces wound penalties from wounds
                by one level.

                An enchantment which causes the target to retain moisture. The

                prevents thirst, and prevents or inhibits the loss of bodily
                fluids such as sweat, tears and urine. The spell eliminates the
                need for water, but does not affect thirst, so it can be used
                to traverse a desert, but not comfortably. After a few days,
                the target becomes bloated with retained moisture; they are
                generally immobilised after five to seven days, and die in ten.

                Connects the affected area to the essence of Odivshe for a short
                time, sucking all heat out of anything touched. Water will freeze
                solid, and living creatures will immediately die if they fail
                their stamina resistence roll. The ground and air will be
                extremely cold until it warms naturally, and all which remain
                in the area afterwards will suffer +30 damage each round, which
                ignores armour. A hot summers day will warm the area in an hour.
                During winter, it may take several hours.
