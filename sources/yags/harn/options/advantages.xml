    </description>
</advantage>


<advantage name="Delusion" type="disadvantage">
    <cost points="-1"/>
    <cost points="-3"/>
    <cost points="-6"/>
    <cost points="-10"/>
    <description>
    The character suffers from a delusion of some kind,
    believing something to be true which very obviously
    isn't. A one point delusion is minor, and won't have
    that much affect. Something like believing that all
    squirrels are spying on everyone is only one point.
    The delusion that squirrels plan on enslaving everyone
    in their nut mines might be three points, if the
    character goes out of their way to avoid squirrels,
    and insists on warning people. Continuously hunting
    for the squirrel's secret nut mines, and hiring people
    to guard against evil squirrel armies would be six
    points. Likewise, belief that the character is a
    Shek-Pvar when they aren't might be six points.
    Belief that they are the king, and ordering everyone
    around would be ten points, since the character is
    likely to end up in trouble with the real king pretty
    quickly.

<advantage name="Favours" type="disadvantage">
    <cost points="-2"/>
    <description>

    <cost points="-15"/>
    <description>

    in your life.
    </description>
</advantage>


<advantage name="Sexually tantalising" type="disadvantage">
    <cost points="-2"/>
    <description>
    You seem to attract members of a compatible sex. For
    anyone else this would be a good thing, except that in
    your case it is always the people whom you don't want
    to attract which are attracted to you. You must have
    attractive to take this drawback.
    </description>
</advantage>


<advantage name="Voracious appetite" type="disadvantage">
    <cost points="-2"/>
    <description>

<advantage name="Youth" type="disadvantage">
    <cost points="-3"/>
    <cost points="-6"/>
    <cost points="-9"/>
    <cost points="-12"/>
    <description>

    and you start with 6 less experience. The youngest you may
    start is 12 years old, in which case you start with general
    skills and 6 points of professional skills.. As well as

    and not take you seriously.
    </description>
</advantage>

    <advantage name="Social class (Outlaw)" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-6"/>
        <description>
            An outlaw has been cast out of society for some crime. It is
            illegal to knowingly give aid to an outlaw, or to seek revenge
            for their death. This often makes the life of an outlaw hard,
            for they are fair game for anyone with a grudge to settle.
        </description>
    </advantage>

    <advantage name="Social class (Slave)" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-4"/>
        <description>
            Slaves have few rights, but they are not just property. Laws
            exist which protect them from the worst of physical abuse,
            and in most cases, it doesn't make economic sense to damage
            a slave, since they can be expensive, and often useful.
        </description>
    </advantage>

    <advantage name="Social class (Serf)" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-2"/>
        <description>
            With more freedom than a slace, serfs consider themselves
            well up the social ladder compared to the former. The reality
            isn't quite as good though. Serfs don't have much economical
            safety, are restricted in their movements by their lord,
            and are often indebted to many weeks of work on their lord's
            land.

    <advantage name="Social class (Freeman)" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+0"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                A freeman is the norm for player characters, since they have
                the most freedom of anyone in society. They can come and go
                as they please, and they have few obligations, but also their
                lord has few obligations to them either. Freemen are allowed
                to carry weapons, though often they are restricted from
                using knightly weapons.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                Player characters who have a social class less than this can
                be difficult to play, since they will need permissions from
                their lord or master before doing anything.

            <para>
                A guilded character is a member of a guild, and as such
                is allowed to practise their profession. The types of
                professions which require guild membership will vary
                from campaign to campaign.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                A guild member will have certain benefits beyond simply
                being allowed to practise a specialist craft (and earn
                money from it). They may have access to tools and supplies,
                and be able to lodge at guild houses either for free, or
                at a discount. Such guild members are often respected
                within the community at large as well, and have the full
                force of their guild to back them up if anyone starts
                causing trouble for them.

            <para>
                A landless noble, often a knight, has many benefits above
                and beyond the common folk, even freemen. Being a noble,
                especially one without land, is no guarantee of wealth
                however, and many such nobles are poor, living by selling
                their sword.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                A knight may carry knightly weapons, and wear knightly
                armour. Their dependents may also be armed as such, in
                order to help defend their noble lord. A knight may also
                own a warhorse.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                A knight can expect aid from other nobles, and respect
                from his lessers, but is expected to live by a code of
                honour, which at least requires him to protect those of
                lesser station from outlaws and wild beasts.

                A landowning noble, like their landless brethren, have a
                number of responsibilities and benefits, and can be
                considered to be the same in all regards except that they
                own a manor, and have people in fief to them.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                A manor does not guarantee wealth, for often everything

                Similar to a landowning noble, however, several manors
                are owned by one of this social class, and other nobles

                wherever they travel, and though they can legally expect
                less than a travelling knight may get, they are truly
                welcomed, for often they are the only source of news
