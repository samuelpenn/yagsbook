<description>
The priest leads a group of people in prayer and ceremony
in order to petition their god. Only those who are of the
same (or a closely allied) faith can gain from this ritual,
and each person can only benefit once a week. The cost must 
be paid by everyone present, in the form of a collection.
Those who don't donate to the church, don't get any benefit.
At the end of the ritual, all those present gain one point
of luck, up to a maximum based on the number of people
present, and the skill of the priest in petitioning the god.
