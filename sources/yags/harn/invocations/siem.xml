<description>
Gives the priest insight into the proper course of action
in a moral quandary. The priest may either ask a question,
or outline a problem. In the former case, a one word answer
of yes, no or maybe will be given. The latter answer is
used when Siem feels that the solution is a personal one for
the priest, and neither course is preferable to the god.
If a problem is presented, then the god will give some
insight, often by highlighting that issue which is of the
most import to Siem. The latter type of question can only
be presented by using the more difficult form of the
invocation.
