            <title>Creating a Character</title>

            <para>
                The first task that a player has is to create a
                character. The first stage in the process is to
                come up with a concept for the character - who
                they are, what they do, and where they come from.
                The GM may want to give some guidelines on this,
                such as character's coming from a particular place,
                or having a certain profession.
            </para>

            <para>
                Once the player has a concept firmly in mind, it
                is time to start solidifying that concept into the
                framework of the game. To do this, there are three
                basic steps:
            </para>

            <orderedlist type="1">
                <item>
                    Roll sunsign.
                </item>
                
                <item>
                    Determine attributes.
                </item>
        
                <item>
                    Choose advantages and disadvantages.
                </item>
                
                <item>
                    Purchase skills.
                </item>
            </orderedlist>

            <para>
                Except for the sunsign, the order in which these
                are performed is not important, though the above
                order will be followed in the steps below. The
                sunsign should be rolled first, and this is the
                only part of character generation which is random.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Choosing a Race</title>

                <para>
                    It is possible to play a non-human character -
                    Sindarin (elves) or Khuzdul (dwarves) are the
                    most common.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If this is desired, then the advantage and
                    disadvantage packages for these races should
                    be perused before making any other decisions.
                    They are given at the end of the advantages
                    section, since they will not make much sense
                    unless the preceding information has been read.
                </para>
            </sect2>

            <sect2>
                <title>Attributes</title>

                <para>
                    The eight attributes listed in the
                    Introduction make up the core definition of
                    a character within the rules. All skills, and
                    therefore any action the character attempts,
                    are based on one of the attributes.
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Determine Attribute Scores</title>

                    <para>
                        The player has 48 points to spend on
                        attributes. The cost of buying attributes
                        is on a pyramid progression - see the chart
                        on this page. A score of one costs one point,
                        whereas a score of three costs six points. An
                        average character, with three in each of the
                        eight attributes (strength, stamina, agility,
                        dexterity, perception, intelligence, charisma,
                        will), costs 48 points.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        It is possible to spend more (or less) points
                        on attributes. If necessary, up to a further
                        twenty points can be purchased as advantages.
                        It is also possible to not spend points, in
                        which case this is counted toward the
                        character's disadvantages.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Details about the attributes, and the costs to
                        advance each one, are given in the Introduction.
                        Advantages and disadvantages are
                        explained in the next section.
                    </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Sunsign</title>

                <para>
                    In Harn, the date of a character's birth can have
                    a real affect on their life. This should be rolled
                    randomly, before the rest of character generation
                    proceeds.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Tuzyn Reckoning (TR) has a 12 month lunar year, and
                    each month has 30 days. Roll d12 to generate the
                    month the character was born, then a d6 followed by
                    a d10 (d6, 1-2 = +0 to d10 roll, 3-4 = +10, 4-6 = +20)
                    to generate the day of the month.

                    A bonus of +1 applies to the attribute in the
                    given situation. For example, someone born under
                    the sign of Tai with a charisma of 3, would have
                    an effective charisma of 4 when teaching someone,
                    or writing a book.

            <title>Advantages and Disadvantages</title>

            <para>
                Advantages are things that give a character an edge
                over others in the world. Each type of advantage has
                a point cost, and a character can take up to twenty
                points worth of advantages, though they can take
                less if desired.
            </para>

            <para>
                The majority of people within the world will have
                significantly less than twenty points, maybe only
                three or four for typical farmers in the field.
            </para>

            <para>
                Disadvantages work against a character, and have a
                negative cost. The total value of advantages and
                disadvantages taken must total zero or less. You
                can buy more disadvantages than you have advantages,
                but no benefit is gained from doing so (other than
                possibly making for a more interesting character).
            </para>

            <para>
                The different types of advantages and disadvantages

                    Spending more than the normal 48 points on
                    attributes counts as an advantage equal in
                    value to the extra points.

                <para>
                    Spending less than the normal 48 points is

                <para>
                    Many characters will have about five points of
                    advantages spent on attributes. More than ten
                    is unusual.

                <para>
                    A character's appearance ranges from -6 to +6,
                    and costs 1 point per level. Its level adds to
                    rolls for social skills when dealing
                    with members of the opposite sex.

                <para>
                    These modify one or more skills in a given
                    situation. No more than one edge or flaw can
                    apply in a given situation (though a single edge,
                    and a single flaw, can combine). If more than one
                    are applicable, then take whichever has the biggest
                    effect.

                        Edges modify a skill under certain
                        circumstances. For example, the absolute
                        direction edge will give a bonus to survival
                        or area lore rolls, but only when the character
                        is trying to find their way.

                        The cost of an edge is different from its level.
                        Costs are listed as +x/y levels, e.g. +1/2 levels.

                    <para>
                        Flaws, similar to edges, give modifiers to
                        skills under certain situations. Unlike edges
                        however, they are detrimental. Further, if the
                        die roll is equal to or less than the value of
                        the flaw, the attempt is an automatic failure
                        (or at least, only a partial success).

                            The wealth of a character is normally
                            related to their social class,
                            though this is not always the case. A
                            very successful merchant could be very
                            rich, but they will still be a mere
                            guilded freeman, of lower
                            rank than a poor nobleman.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            A typical freeman will own 100 + d20 x 5
                            pence in goods and property. Most of this
                            will be property - a house, with a small
                            plot of land, some chickens and maybe a
                            cow. 10% of this may be cash, or other
                            easily exchangeable goods. Cashing in
                            property will be difficult, since there
                            won't be anyone able to afford it, except
                            for the local lord who will
                            probably figure he can just move in anyway
                            for free once the character
                            has vanished off 'adventuring'.

                            character begins with. A mercenary will
                            have a sword and armour in place of land,
                            a merchant may have a small shop, or a
                            caravan and some mules.

                            point of advantage to increase the amount of wealth by a multiple.
                            One point will double starting wealth, 2 points will triple it etc.

                            more than their peers. For every
                            point of advantage, they may start the
                            game with two extra points of skills
                            (explained later). Such points may be
                            spent during the character's adulthood,
                            and do not add to the character's age.

                        The reputation of a character can greatly affect how other people
                        react to them. Reputations can be good or bad, and are respectively
                        considered to be an advantage or a disadvantage.

                        you. Other modifiers may be used, as decided by the GM. A reputation
                        must have been gained for some reason, so the player and GM should
                        decide how the character got his reputation.

                    <title>Duty</title>

                    <para>
                        A duty is an obligation to a cause,
                        organisation or person. It can take up much
                        of your time, and you may welcome it, or resent
                        it, but either way, when it calls, you must do
                        your utmost to fulfill it.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A duty is always a disadvantage. The base cost
                        depends on how regularly you will be called on
                        to fulfill your obligations. Each season, the
                        GM will roll 2d10 against the chance given in the
                        duty table. If you are called up to serve a
                        duty, then the amount of time it takes is
                        variable, probably of a few weeks, but could
                        be anything from a day, to a season.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The cost of the duty is multiplied by how
                        much danger is generally involved in carrying
                        out the duty. If you have a duty to serve
                        as judge in a court of law occasionally, then
                        the risk is minimal. If you have a duty to
                        protect a town, which is often raided by
                        giants and dragons, then it could be considered
                        to be perilous. A fyrd duty to a lord would be
                        a common duty, with moderate risk, for a cost
                        of -6.

                    <title>Allies and Enemies</title>

                    <para>
                        You can begin the game with a powerful NPC
                        as either a friend or enemy. An ally is
                        considered to be an advantage, whereas an
                        enemy is a disadvantage.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The base cost depends on how frequently the
                        enemy turns up. Each adventure, the GM rolls
                        two dice, and if the target number is met, then
                        the given enemy will be around to make your
                        life more interesting. Likewise, if you try
                        to call on an ally for help, then the chance
                        of them helping is found in a similar way.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        It should be noted that a powerful enemy is probably going to
                        send capable henchmen to deal with you pretty rapidly. If they
                        catch you, they'll probably kill you without too much difficulty,
                        so taking such an enemy will mean that you will be on the run
                        for a long time, until you are able to deal with the threat.
                        A very powerful enemy or ally who turns up most of the time will
                        not normally be possible, since the cost exceeds the 20 point
                        limit for characters.

                <para>
                    A character's luck is a measure of how lucky
                    they are. Most people have a luck of zero,
                    which represents being neither particularly
                    lucky nor unlucky. Lucky characters possibly
                    have the favour of a god, or other power, who
                    is looking out for them.

                <para>
                    Luck can be gained by taking part in major
                    religious ceremonies. When checking for luck
                    in a situation, roll 1d20, add the character's
                    current luck, and compare against the following
                    difficulties.

                    Luck (+1 / level): This can be taken up to five
                    times, to give the character a +5 luck. Each
                    point of luck gives a +1 bonus on luck rolls.
                    At any time, a luck point can be spent to give a
                    one time immediate effect to get the character out
                    of a sticky situation. The effect is up to the GM,
                    but examples would be that a fatal blow leaves the
                    character wounded and unconscious, a fumble is
                    turned into a simple failure, or a failure into
                    success. Luck is bestowed by the gods, so only
                    characters who are part of a religion can have
                    luck points.

                    Passions range in strength from +1 (a slight
                    quirk) to +5 (controls your life). Passions of
                    level +1 or +2 cost nothing, and may be taken
                    freely to round out the character. Passions of
                    +3 or higher must be paid for as advantages or
                    disadvantages.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Most passions are considered disadvantages, since
                    they restrict how a character behaves. There are
                    three broad groups of passions - minor, lesser and
                    greater, which are based on how much effect the
                    passion will have on the character's actions.

                        humans, but there is a reason humans have

                        Sindarin are very different in outlook to humans, a fact brought
                        on by their immortal lifespan. They have a great interest in the
                        contemplation of nature, of philosophy and meditation. They do not

                        a further cumulative -1 for each successive week of study. A
                        Sindarin will be at -4 penalty for her fifth week of study.

                        If a break is taken from study, the penalty is reduced by one for
                        every two weeks that pass without study. The Sindarin finds her
                        mind drifting onto other things, and must spend time fulfilling
                        her inner desires before continuing with such intensive study.

                    skill can be given a score above 4, and all must have a score
                    of at least one. Skill cost is per the pyramid point cost system
                    as used for attributes.

                        A character will start with a reasonable
                        knowledge of the world they live in - though
                        their 'world' may well be limited to a single
                        village. This knowledge is represented by the
                        following three starting skills, which default
                        to the following scores.

                        Language skills are treated on a scale from

                        like other skills. Instead, the level of skill
                        gives a guide to how much of a conversation a

                    At the age of 16, a character is assumed to be
                    an adult, and can enter play. Many players may
                    well feel that their character isn't quite

                    Characters may begin at any age the player wants
                    above 16, but characters which start above 35
                    years of age will have to make aging rolls before
                    the game begins (so could possibly die).

                            is based on stamina, and each 10 points rolled gives an equivalence
                            to one level of berserker advantage.

                        <description>
                            It is believed that dreams give glimpses of the inner
                            mind of a person, and also of their future. The ability to
                            understand dreams, and to garner useful knowledge from them is
                            difficult to master. At worst though, someone with this skill
                            can give impressive interpretations of a dream, if not entirely
                            accurate. Based on intelligence, and taught by the priests of Siem.
