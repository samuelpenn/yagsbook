                Harn is far from being Magic Weak. Although uncommon,
                accomplished magi with awesome powers do exist.
                Characters with the interest and natural ability to
                practice the hidden arts have the option to enter an
                elite vocation that demands skill and dedication to
                prosper.

                <para>
                    The Guild of Arcane Lore is a loose association of
                    alchemists, astrologers, magi, rune masters etc.
                    The Shek-Pvar is a sub-organisation (actually, six
                    separate organisations) within the guild. Shek-Pvar
                    subscribe to a doctrine called Pvarism. This doctrine
                    perceives and describes Kelestia (everything that
                    exists) in terms of six key elemental principles:
                    Air, Fire, Metal, Earth, Water and Spirit. Because
                    manipulation of these elements imposed unique
                    demands upon the mind and body, six schools of
                    arcane lore evolved, each stressing one of the
                    elements.

            <title>Convocations</title>

            <para>
                A Shek-Pvar first attunes to a Primary convocation and
                learns primary spells. Adjacent to this are the
                secondary convocations and spells. Those two removed
                are tertiary. The convocation opposite the primary is
                the diametric. These relationships are symbolised by the
                Pvaric Wheel.

            <para>
                There is a seventh 'element', which is neutrality.
                Neutrality is represented by the colour grey, and
                corresponds to counter magic, inter world travel
                and energy storage.

            <title>Spells</title>

            <para>
                Knowledge of convocations is merely theoretical. In
                order to apply that knowledge and actually cast a
                spell, the Shek-Pvar must have knowledge of the spell
                in question.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is not possible for a Shek-Pvar to cause a magical
                effect without having learned a spell to perform that
                effect. Spontaneous magical effects are not possible
                according to currently understood theories
                of Pvarism.
            </para>

            <para>
                A Shek-Pvar has a skill with each spell. Learning spells
                is actually quite easy, and it is possible to rapidly
                achieve a useful skill level with a spell.

                <title>Casting Spells</title>

                <para>
                    In order to cast a spell, the Shek-Pvar multiplies
                    together their convocation skill and their spell
                    skill. In effect, the convocation is treated as
                    the attribute, and the spell is the skill. If this
                    total matches the level of spell, then the spell is
                    successfully cast.

                    <title>Fatigue</title>

                    <para>
                        Casting a spell can result in fatigue, the amount
                        depending on how well the spell was cast, and the
                        relationship of the spell's convocation to that
                        of the Shek-Pvar.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A spell in a Shek-Pvar's primary convocation can
                        be cast without fatigue if the casting roll is
                        five or more points above the level of the spell.
                        Any roll less than this causes one point of long
                        term fatigue, regardless of whether the spell was
                        cast or not. A diametric spell will always cause
                        at least one level of fatigue. Neutral spells are
                        considered to be equal to secondary spells
                        for the purposes of fatigue.

                        Any failure to cast a spell results in the
                        maximum amount of fatigue for that type of spell
                        (so a failure to cast a tertiary or diametric
                        spell causes four levels of fatigue to be lost).
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A spell casting which results in unconsciousness
                        is still a success, though if the spell requires
                        concentration, then concentration
                        is immediately lost.

                    <para>
                        A spell, when cast, generally requires some form
                        of verbalisation and gesturing. Normally this
                        consists of half a dozen to a dozen words, and
                        the waving of an arm or arms, often denoting the
                        target or area to be affected.
                    </para>
                    
                    <para>
                        The spell must be spoken in a firm voice, so
                        casting is rarely subtle. However, in the midst
                        of a loud combat, or marketplace, it may be
                        drowned out by other noises.

                        <para>
                            If desired, the Shek-Pvar can try to cast
                            the spell more subtly. Doing so gives a
                            casting penalty of -5 per rank of the spell.
                            However, verbal component is reduced to a
                            quiet voice, and arm movements are minimised.
                            Such will still be obvious to someone
                            watching (or talking to) the Shek-Pvar, but
                            it will be harder for others to spot.

                            by shouting the words of the spell, and using
                            exaggerated gestures. This gives a +5 to the
                            casting roll per rank of the spell.

                            Another way to improve the chance of casting
                            a spell is to carefully prepare it. Doing so
                            takes three times longer than normal, as well
                            as being bold and booming.

                            The bonus in this case is +10 per rank of the
                            spell being cast. The spell also requires
                            that a magic circle is enscribed on the floor
                            around the caster. This takes one round per
                            rank of the highest spell being cast. This
                            only needs to be done once however, and as
                            many spells as desired can be cast from
                            within the circle as long as they are all of
                            the same convocation. Each convocation beyond
                            the first adds an extra round to the time
                            taken to scribe the circle.

                            Fast casting a spell is very subtle,
                            and has the added benefit of taking much
                            shorter time. The spell has no verbal or
                            gesture requirements, plus, it may be
                            combined with other actions, even talking
                            or fighting.

                            Only spells with a duration of 1 round can
                            be fast cast. The spell occurs on the caster's
                            initiative, then following that any other
                            action can be performed, including casting
                            another spell. However, a second spell cannot
                            be fast cast, though suffers the same fast
                            cast penalty as the original spell.

                            The level of a spell is a measure of how
                            complicated it is to cast. Spells have
                            seven different complexity ranks, and each
                            rank has a different level associated with
                            it. Many spells can also be boosted beyond
                            their basic level. If the spell is cast at
                            this level (and the level is chosen before
                            the spell is attempted),
                            then extra effects come into play.

                            the Neutral and Peleahn convocations. If

                            Peleahn convocation. If summoning a Grey
                            Elemental, she would use her Neutral

                            Most spells can be cast in a single round. If
                            a casting time is not given for a spell, then
                            assume it can be cast in one round. Such spells
                            occur during the normal initiative phase within
                            combat. The Shek-Pvar uses agility x spell
                            skill, with a penalty of -5 per spell rank for
                            their initiative total.

                            are cast in. Normally such spells aren't
                            used in combat situations anyway, so it is

                                a spell, then a will roll may be needed in
                                order to maintain concentration. If damage
                                is sustained, a will check of difficulty
                                10 + 5 x body levels is required. If
                                successful, spell casting may proceed at
                                -5 per wound.

                                allows spell casting to continue at a -15

                                Concentrating on a single spell does not
                                preclude other actions - including casting other
                                spells. It is even possible to concentrate on
                                more than one spell at once, though it does get
                                progressively harder.

                                The first spell gives a -5 penalty to all

                                it is being concentrated on. The second spell
                                gives a further -10 penalty, the third a -15
                                penalty and so on. All penalties are
                                cumulative. Concentrating on three spells gives
                                a total -30 penalty.

                                If the character suffers body levels of damage
                                when concentrating on spells, a will check of
                                difficulty 5 per body level is needed (remember
                                the penalty for concentrating on spells).
                                Failure means that half (round up) the spells
                                are dropped. The Shek-Pvar chooses which spells
                                to drop.

                                a momentary magical duration, though the
                                effects last until the target next sleeps.
                                It is most common with mind affecting spells.

                                waking (and the magic remains until then as
                                well, so can be dispelled). Four hours of
                                sleep is enough to end the effects of the

                                Spells with a duration of ward go dormant
                                when they are cast. They can be detected
                                and dispelled while dormant, though will
                                rarely have a visible presence. When a
                                trigger condition is met (this varies from
                                spell to spell), the spell is activated,
                                and its powers come into effect. The actual
                                powers of the spell generally have a
                                duration of momentary, so once the ward has
                                been activated, it terminates.

                                Only one ward can be placed on an object,
                                location or person at any one time. If a
                                second ward is placed, then it automatically
                                fails. A second ward cannot be placed within
                                an aura of a living creature. It is not
                                possible for a person to carry two items
                                which are both warded. One of the wards
                                (choose randomly) fails if this happens.

                                There are exceptions however. Some wards can
                                be stacked with themselves. These are rare,
                                and stacking always has other side effects.

                    When a Shek-Pvar is first trained, they are trained
                    in a single convocation. They are attuned to this
                    convocation for the rest of their life, and with
                    the exception of becoming a Grey Mage, they cannot

                    Later, it may be possible to learn a different

                    learned before a corresponding Tertiary convocation.
                    'Learned' in this case means up to a level of at
                    least four. The diametrically opposed convocation
                    can only be learned if both tertiary

                    take many months, or even years, so most Shek-Pvar
                    prefer learning from the work of others, rather than
                    re-inventing the wheel.

                    For each week that is spent studying or inventing a
                    spell, the Shek-Pvar rolls on the Experience gained
                    through training table in Campaign:2. Spells however
                    are quicker to develop than normal knowledges, so get

                    There is a bonus to the study total equal to the

                    is a further +1 for every spell in that convocation
                    which is known at a higher level than the spell being

                    every five points higher than the study difficulty,
                    an extra point of experience is gained that week.

                <para>
                    Initially written to help mavari in their studies,
                    grimoires have become quite common at all levels of
                    skill. They are basically a collection of tracts on
                    a number of different spells. Study of the grimoire
                    will provide knowledge in each of the spells covered.

                <para>
                    Like any other book, a grimoire has a level and a
                    quality. When a week is spent studying the grimoire,
                    for each spell which the reader has a lower score in
                    than the level of the grimoire, they get one study
                    gain roll, at the quality of the grimoire. A study
                    roll is possible even if the student has no skill
                    in the spell.

                        The author chooses the spells to write about.
                        Any number of spells can be chosen, however
                        they must all be of the same rank, and the
                        same convocation.

                    <para>
                        The maximum level of the grimoire is equal to the

            <title>The End of Apprenticeship</title>

            <para>
                Beginning Shek-Pvar PCs are assumed to have come to
                the end of their apprenticeship. They have been
                released from the bond of apprenticeship and sent
                into the world as one of the Satia-Mavari (journeyman).
                They are expected to survive on their wits for at
                least a year and a day. Any time after that, they
                may return with a suitable gift for their chantry.
                Normally, this consists of three items of value, and
                three 'original-arts', meaning spells
                the former master does not know how to cast.
            </para>

            <para>
                Most Satia-Mavari take three to five years to complete
                this part of their training. After this they may become
                Shenava (Master) or Viran (Grandmaster).

            <title>Pvaric Elementals</title>

            <para>
                Pvarism is restricted to only affected that which is in sight,
                and even the more powerful magics are restricted in their effects
                at long range. However, the Shek-Pvar do have a way of affecting
                that which would otherwise be beyond their reach, and this is
                through the use of elementals.
            </para>

            <para>
                Each of the convocations has a type of elemental associated with
                it. Elementals are sapient spirits formed from the element of
                their convocation. A common use is to use them as scouts, to spy
                on places a long way away, or to carry messages between Shek-Pvar.
                Elementals range greatly in power, and the individual types will
                be described in the section detailing the relevant convocation.
                However, a brief guide to them is given here.

            <sect2>
                <title>Types of Elemental</title>

                <para>
                    The strength and capability of an elemental is measured according
                    to its type. A type I elemental is barely sapient, and has little
                    physical strength. Type VIII elementals are amongst the most powerful
                    normally dealt with. They can be quite intelligent, strong willed,
                    and very powerful physically.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each type of elemental corresponds to a complexity rank for spells.
                    Most spells to control elementals are multi-level, and also common.
                    This means a different spell is needed to summon an elemental
                    of Peleahn instead of a Lyahvi elemental.

                        A type I elemental is the weakest elemental it is
                        possible to summon. It has a base intelligence and
                        will of one, and is incapable of understanding
                        anything but the simplest of commands.

                        Such an elemental can be ordered to

                        see if it can see movement, or to carry or fetch

                        conversations, or describe things in detail.

                        commands, such as to give warning if something
                        happens, or to follow a person. They can count
                        and recognise things which are not directly
                        related to themselves.

                        a person. The message cannot be more than a few

                        its own initiative, and can remember (though not
                        understand) human speech.

                        guard and protect someone, to listen on a
                        conversation and report back, or to hunt down

                    <para>
                        An elemental is summoned with the use of the Summon Elemental
                        spell. This is a common spell, and one version of it exists
                        for each convocation.

                    <para>
                        Summoning an elemental takes one minute. The elemental always
                        appears next to the summoner, and a ego check must be made by
                        both the summoner and the elemental as soon as it arrives, in
                        order to see if the elemental is controlled. If control fails,
                        then the elemental will do as it pleases. Roll a d20, on a
                        1-19, it returns to where it came from. On a 20, it goes on a
                        random rampage, attacking anything in sight.

                    <para>
                        Assuming the elemental is controlled, then it can be given
                        commands. Very simple commands can be given with gestures,
                        however anything more complicated requires the caster to speak
                        and understand a Pvaric language. This can normally be done
                        with the Speak with Elemental spell.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The elemental must normally remain within range of the spell.
                        If the elemental ever leaves the spell range, then another
                        ego check is required to maintain control of the elemental.
                        On failure, control is lost as when the elemental is first
                        summoned. Success, allows the elemental to be controlled, but
                        a further check is required each minute it remains beyond the
                        normal spell range. An out of range elemental will halt and
                        rest, awaiting further instruction.

                    A minor artifact can be used by anyone if the trigger event is
                    physical (such as a word or action). If the trigger event is a
                    mental command, then the user must have attuned to the item first,
                    which more or less restricts the item to Shek-Pvar.
                </para>

                <para>
                    When the item is activated, the last spell stored in it is cast
                    at the target designated by the user. If the user has attuned to
                    the item, then they may choose which spell is cast.

                    The spell goes off on the initiative of the user. For physical

                Major artifacts are more powerful, more flexible and longer lasting
                than minor artifacts. They are also more complicated to construct,
                and take much longer to make. Whereas a minor artifact can be
                constructed in a couple of days, a major artifact can take several
                months to build.

                <title>Creating the Artifact</title>
                
                <para>
                    The first stage of artifact creation is to purify a
                    suitable item, by use of the <i>Focus</i> spell. This
                    attunes it to the correct convocation. A Grey Mage may
                    create Grey items, which are capable of using all
                    convocations. Other magi however are limited to creating
                    artifacts of only a single convocation. It does not
                    have to be the primary convocation of the magus.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    The second stage is to summon and trap a spirit. The
                    False Soul spell does this, crafting an elemental
                    spirit of a particular type. False Soul is always a
                    neutral spell. As for summoning elementals, the rank
                    of the False Soul summons a spirit of equal rank.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    When the spirit is summoned, it can be given a purpose.
                    Binding a spirit to a single purpose gives it more
                    power, at the expense of limiting what it will be
                    willing to do. A spirit with a purpose also has more
                    intelligence, so is able to act on its own violation.

                    <para>
                        The normal sort of elementals that get summoned won't
                        do when creating a major artifact. False Soul creates
                        a special sort of spirit. It has a convocation score
                        in its element, which is equal to some multiple of
                        its will. The will of a False Soul is equal to its
                        rank.

                        The multiplier depends on the purpose which the soul
                        is given. The more restrictive the purpose, the higher
                        the multiplier, but getting the soul to do anything
                        contrary to its purpose, is difficult at best.

                        it a purpose. The narrower the purpose, the more
                        powerful the spirit.

                            User has to attune themselves to the item. When a
                            spell is used, make a stamina roll of 10 + 5 x rank
                            of spell, or gain one fatigue. If spell matches
                            convocation of both item and user, difficulty
                            reduced by 10.
