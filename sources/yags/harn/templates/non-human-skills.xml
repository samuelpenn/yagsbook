<character-template name="Sindarin Starting Skills">
	<description>
		<background>
			<para>
			Sindarin begin the game much older than human characters, generally
			in the region of 50 to 150 years. Older Sindarin are possible,
			but it's difficult to rationalise a Sindarin of this age being
			of 'beginning character' capability.
			</para>
			<para>
			The Sindarin character's age should be chosen by the player, and
			it has no effect on the number of skill points gained. Sindarin
			are a fickle lot, and how much a Sindarin has learnt is as much
			a factor of their mood for the last few decades, as it is of their
			age.
			</para>
			<para>
			Sindarin player characters have a further 20 experience points
			to place on skills on their choice. If they wish to buy further
			experience with advantages, this is possible. Sindarin characters
            start with a lot of skills, though not much flexibility.

	<description>

			<para>
			Khuzdul player characters will start the game somewhere between
			50 and 100 years of age. Khuzdul live well into their third century,
			sometimes longer, so this is considered to be a young adult.
			</para>
			<para>
			Characters get a further 20 experience points to spend on other
			skills. There is no modification of experience for age. Khuzdul
			characters may buy extra experience with advantages, at the normal
			rates.
