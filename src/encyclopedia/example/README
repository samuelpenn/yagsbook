Example Encyclopedia
====================

(this guide has been written from the point of view of Linux. Translation to
non-UNIX-like operating systems is left as an exercise to the reader).

In order to generate the example Encyclopedia, type the following:

ant

That's it, assuming that you have ant installed and you are in the example
directory. It will generate a set of HTML files in the ./tmp directory,
which will have the following structure:

tmp
    entries - this is where the HTML files are copied to.
	images - all the images are copied into here.
	source - all the source XML files are copied into here.

Browse to tmp/entries/index.html for the front page of the Encyclopedia.
All content, indexes and category lists are underneath the entries
directory. Actual entries are split according to the first letter of the
filename - e.g., entries/a/a*.html, entries/b/b*.html etc.
