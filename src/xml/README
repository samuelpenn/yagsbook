Installation
------------

The location of XSLT and CSS files is being changed to the following
locations:

/usr/share/xml/yagsbook
    pagexml
        xslt
            html
                *.xsl
        css
            *.css
    article
        xslt
            html
               *.xsl
            pdf
               *.xsl
            share
               *.xsl
        css
            *.css

The base directory [/usr/share/xml/yagsbook] may be different on non-UNIX
architectures, but that's for other people to worry about. At the very
least, all files will be in these locations on a web server, and will be
found in http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/usr/share/xml/yagsbook on the
main project site.

Currently, most Yagsbook software and documents assume that these files are
all available under the directory /usr/share/web.

This may later change to be:

http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/usr/share/xml

The most recent version of all these files will be available in this
location, but there are no plans to support versioning, and they may change
at any time.
